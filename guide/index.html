<!-- Introduction -->

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Security Auditing Framework and Evaluation Template for Advocacy Groups (SAFETAG) is a professional audit framework that adapts traditional penetration testing and risk assessment methodologies to be relevant to small, non-profit, human rights organizations based or operating in the developing world.</p>
<p>SAFETAG is based upon a set of principles, activities, and best practices to allow digital security auditors to best support at-risk organizations by working with them to identify the risks they face, the next steps they need to take to address them, and guidance on how to seek out support in the future.</p>
<p>SAFETAG audits are targeted at serving small scale civil society organizations or independent media houses who have strong digital security concerns but do not have the funds to afford a traditional digital security audit. The traditional security-audit framework is based upon the assumption that an organization has the time, money, and capacity to aim for as close to perfect security as possible. Low-income at-risk groups have none of these luxuries. These audits are both far too expensive, and produce output that is too complex for these organizations to act upon.</p>

<!-- Overview -->


<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>SAFETAG uses a customized combination of selected assessment activities derived from standards in the security auditing world and best-practices for working with small scale at-risk organizations to provide organization driven risk assessment and mitigation consultation. SAFETAG auditors lead an organizational risk modeling process that helps staff and leadership take an institutional lens on their digital security problems, conduct a targeted digital security audit to expose vulnerabilities that impact the vital processes and assets identified, and provide post-audit reporting and follow up that helps the organization and staff identify the training and technical support that they need to address needs identified in the audit, and in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<!-- Audit Lifecyce -->

<h1 id="the-safetag-audit-framework">The SAFETAG Audit Framework</h1>
<p>The SAFETAG audit consists of multiple information gathering and confirmations steps as well as research and capacity-building exercises with staff organized in a collection of objectives, each of which supports the core goals of SAFETAG, creating a risk assessment while also building the capacity of the organization.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/activities_flow.svg" alt="SAFETAG Activities" /><figcaption>SAFETAG Activities</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="the-life-cycle-of-an-audit-1">The Life Cycle of an Audit</h2>
<p>The audit process in very cyclical. Newly identified threats, vulnerabilities, capabilities, and barriers impact activities that have and have yet to be run. At the same time the auditor, through conversations, training, and group activities is actively building the organizations agency and addressing time-sensitive or critical threats that are possible within the time frame. This iterative process eventually leads to a point where the auditor is confident they have identified the critical and low hanging fruit, and is confident the organization is capable of moving forward with their recommendations.</p>
<p>Each objective requires a certain base of information, and outputs more information into this cyclical process. Each objective has a &quot;map&quot; of the data flow that it and its specific activities provide based on this map:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/info_flows/data_flow_all.svg" alt="SAFETAG Data Flow" /><figcaption>SAFETAG Data Flow</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While more completely defined below in the Risk Assessment and Agency Building sections, a brief overview of the data flow components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actors</strong> Actors are the people connected to an organization include an organization's staff, board members, contractors and partners. Actors could also include volunteers, members of a broader community of practice, and even family members. Actors also include potential adversaries of the organization such as competing groups.</li>
<li><strong>Activities</strong> Activities are the actions and processes of an organization. While most NGO work revolves around mission-based concepts, activities also include things like payroll.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong> Indicators of capacity include staff skills and a wide variety of resources that an organization can draw from to affect change.</li>
<li><strong>Barriers</strong> Barriers are specific challenges an organization faces that might limit or block its capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Assets</strong> Assets are most easily conceptualized as computer systems - laptops and servers, but also include both the data stored on them and can also be services like remote file storage, hosted websites, webmail, and more. Offline drives, USB sticks, and even paper printouts of relevant or sensitive information can also be included</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong> Vulnerabilities are specific flaws or attributes of an asset susceptible to attack.</li>
<li><strong>Threats</strong> A Threat is a specific, possible attack or occurrence that could harm the organization. If a bucket of oily rags is a vulnerability, a fire is the threat - and mitigations would be rules against leaving oily rags around as well as fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, remote backup policies, and evacuation planning.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make SAFETAG approachable, a core evaluation template which links together a series of specific objectives, each with a variety of linked activities, that contribute towards the goals and their required information needs is represented here. Experienced Auditors will likely come up with their own approaches, and the SAFETAG project welcomes such contributions.</p>
<p><!-- Risk Modeling --></p>
<h2 id="risk-assessment-analysis">Risk Assessment &amp; Analysis</h2>
<p>Functionally, SAFETAG is a digital risk assessment framework. Risk assessment a systematic approach to identifying and assessing risks associated with hazards and human activities. SAFETAG focuses this approach on digital security risks. A SAFETAG audit will work to collect the following types of information in order to assess the risks an organization faces.</p>
<p>Risk is the current assessment of the possibility of harmful events occurring. Risk is assessed by comparing the threats an actor faces with their vulnerabilities, and their capacity to respond to or mitigate emergent threats.</p>
<p>The SAFETAG evaluation revolves around collecting enough information to identify and assess the various risks and an organization and its related actors face so that they can take action strategically.</p>

<h3 id="program-analysis">Program Analysis</h3>
<p>Program analysis identifies the priority objectives of the organization and determine its capacities. This process exposes the activities, actors, and capacities of an organization.</p>
<h4 id="activities-1">Activities</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The practices and interactions that the organization carries out in order to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> This includes any activity that the organization carries out to accomplish its goals and those that allow the organization to function (publishing, payment, fund-raising, outreach, interviewing.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main purpose of the organization?</li>
<li>What are the processes the organization takes part in to carry out their work?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="actors">Actors</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The staff, volunteers, partners, beneficiaries, donors, and adversaries associated with the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The core organizational staff, the volunteers, maintenance, cleaning, security, or other non-critical staff, the partner organizations, the individuals and groups that the organization provides services to, groups of unorganized individuals who are opposed to organizational aims, governmental and non-governmental high-power agents and organizations that are opposed to the organizations aims.</p>
<ul>
<li>What staff does the organization have?</li>
<li>Are their volunteers, maintenance, cleaning, security, or other non-critical staff who have access to the office?</li>
<li>Who does the organization serve?</li>
<li>Does the organization have any partners?</li>
<li>Who are the organizations beneficiaries?</li>
</ul>
<p><why is it important to identify the partners, benificiaries, etc. instead of just focusing on the organization?></p>
<h3 id="vulnerability-analysis">Vulnerability analysis</h3>
<p>Understand the organisation’s exposure to threats, points of weakness and the ways in which the organisation may be affected.</p>
<h4 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A attribute or feature that makes an entity, asset, system, or network susceptible to a given threat.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> This can include poorly built or unmaintained hardware, software, or offices as well as missing, ignored, or poor policies or practices around security.</p>
<h3 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h3>
<p>Threat analysis is the process of identifying possible attackers and gathering background information about the capability of those attackers to threaten the organization. The basis of this information is a potential threats <strong>history</strong> of carrying out specific threats, their <strong>capability</strong> to carry out those threats currently, and proof that the threat has <strong>intent</strong> to leverage resources against the target.</p>
<h4 id="threat">Threat</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A threat is a possible attack or occurrence that has the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, and/or property.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Threats can range from <em>fire,</em> or <em>flood,</em> to <em>targeted malware,</em> <em>physical harassment,</em> or <em>phishing attacks.</em></p>
<h4 id="threat-history">Threat History</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> What types of threats has the attacker used historically. And, what types of actors have been targeted by those threats.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What history of attacks does the threat actor have?</li>
<li>What techniques have they used? Have they targeted vulnerabilities that the organization currently has?</li>
<li>Have they targeted similar organizations?</li>
<li>What is known about the types of threats used by an threat actor to attack similar organizations?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="threat-capability">Threat Capability</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The means that the attacker has to carry out threats against the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> This includes, but is not limited to technical skill, financial support, number of staff hours, and legal power.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the threat actor have the means to exploit a vulnerability that the organization currently has?</li>
<li>Does the threat actor have the means to leverage widespread threats against all similar organizations, or will they have to prioritize their targets?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="threat-intent">Threat Intent</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The level of desire for the attacker to carry out threats against the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Intent can be goals or outcomes that the adversary seeks; consequences the adversary seeks to avoid; and how strongly the adversary seeks to achieve those outcomes and/or avoid those consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the threat actor currently have the desire to conduct an attack against this type of organization?</li>
<li>Is the organization a priority threat target for the threat actor?</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- Agency Building --></p>
<h2 id="agency-building">Agency Building</h2>
<p>SAFETAG differs from many risk assessment tools because it aims to build the host's and staff's capacity so that they are able to address the risks that the auditor has identified. SAFETAG is designed to provide in-audit activities and training that increase an organizations agency to seek out and address security challenges within their organization. To do this an auditor must collect information that allows them to identify organizational areas of strength and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.)</p>
<p>A common refrain, among auditors, software developers and other specialists in this sector, is that digital security is not about technology; it is about people. This is undeniably true, and even the previous SAFETAG modules — despite their more direct fixation on technology — acknowledge this insight by emphasizing the educational and a persuasive roles played by your findings report.</p>
<h3 id="capacity">Capacity</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The combination of strengths, attributes and resources available within the organization that can be used to reduce the impact or likelihood of threats.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> This includes, but is not limited to technical skill, financial support, staff and management time, relationships, and legal power.</p>
<h3 id="barriers">Barriers</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The combination of weaknesses, assumptions, regulations, social or cultural practices, and obligations that get in the way of an organization implementing an effective digital security practice.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Examples can include a lack of funding, lack of authority within an organization to mandate practices to their staff, resistance to change, high staff turnover, or digital illiteracy.</p>
<p><!-- Operational Security --></p>
<h2 id="operational-security-1">Operational Security</h2>
<p>&quot;<em>Also be aware that local groups may not be able to accurately gauge the safety of their communications with you. Sometimes they underestimate the likelihood of risk - at other times, they can wildly overestimate the risk. Either way, trainers need to navigate this issues carefully and respectfully with a &quot;do no harm&quot; approach that respects the reported needs, context, and experiences of your local contact and potential trainees.</em>&quot; - <em>Needs Assessment: Level-Up</em> <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="summary-2">Summary</h3>
<p>Below are the baseline operational security guidelines for a SAFETAG audit. Activity specific operational security guidelines are contained within each activity.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-1">Purpose</h3>
<p>An audit uncovers an array of sensitive information about an organization. For some at-risk populations the mere act of getting a digital security audit can increase their likelihood of being actively attacked by an adversary. The foundation of the SAFETAG process is the goal of increasing the safety of the host organization, its staff, and the auditor. It is vital that an auditor weigh the possible risk and audit may incur on the organization or the auditor against the possible outcomes of an audit.</p>
<h3 id="objectives-1">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data storage security
<ul>
<li>Keep ALL data related to the audit secured per the <a href="http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Pre-engagement#PGP_and_Other_Alternatives">Pentest Standards for data security</a>, from interview and research notes through audit findings and reporting outputs. Additional notes per section.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Communications security
<ul>
<li>Conduct all communication with the client over at least minimally secure channels where the communication is encrypted in transit at all times per the <a href="http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Pre-engagement#PGP_and_Other_Alternatives">Pentest Standards for data security</a>.</li>
<li>Higher levels of security (such as PGP, truecrypt, or minilock) should be used for all file and document transfers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><!-- Audit Prep--></p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<h3 id="summary-3">Summary</h3>
<p>This component consists of trip preparation activities that are needed to ensure the technical and facilitated components of the audit are able to be conducted effectively and within the on-site time-frame and in coordination with the organization.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-2">Purpose</h3>
<p>A SAFETAG audit has a short time frame. Preparation is vital to ensure that time on the ground is not spent negotiating over the audit scope, updating the auditors systems, searching for missing hardware, or refreshing oneself with the SAFETAG framework. To that end negotiations with the host organization help reveal if the organization has the capacity to undertake the audit and respond to its findings.</p>
<h3 id="guiding-questions-1">Guiding Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Does the organization have existing digital security practice or attempted to implement them in the past?</li>
<li>What is the process for procedure for incident handling in the event that auditor cause or uncover an incident during the course of the assessment?</li>
<li>What are the legal, physical, or social risks for the auditor &amp; organization associated with conducting the audit or having audit results leak? <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>Does the security situation of the location or organization require additional planning? Are your software tools up to date and working as expected?</li>

<h4>Assessment Plan</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This component allows an auditor and host to come to an understanding of the level of access that an auditor will have, what is off limits, and the process for modifying the scope of the audit when new information arises. <a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This component consists of a process where the auditor collaboratively creates an assessment plan with key members of the organization.</p>
<p>A core tenet of SAFETAG is building agency in organizations to improve their digital security. To that end, collaboratively creating an assessment plan with the organization helps to clarify not only the audit scope - from discussing what sensitive data may be exposed to what systems may be disrupted in the process of the audit - but it also helps reveal the ability of the organization to support and respond to the audit findings.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Determine a point person for the audit and exchange contact information. <a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
<li>Explain and get approval to the scope of audit from the host. <a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></li>
<li>Agree to the time-line, location, and attendees of the on-site audit. <a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></li>
<li>Codify data security standards for audit communication and evidence handling. <a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></li>
<li>If funded externally, identify what should be reported to external funder. <a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the overall mandate to send information encrypted to the organization, also demand encrypted communication back from them. Failure to establish a secure planning channel also contributes towards a no-go situation by putting both the auditor and organization at risk.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<ul>
<li>An agreement signed by both parties outlining the scope of the audit including:
<ul>
<li>The start and end dates of the audit.</li>
<li>The location where the on-site audit will take place. <a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></li>
<li>The responsibilities of the host staff.</li>
<li>The responsibilities of the auditor.</li>
<li>The host names and IP ranges of any services run by the organization. <a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></li>
<li>Emergency contact information for the organization. <a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></li>
<li>The procedure the auditor will follow when handling incidents. <a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></li>

<h3>Audit Timeline and Planning</h3>
<p>Review these notes in preparation for the audit as you begin to map out your schedule. This provides a rough, suggested outline of how to schedule your time on site for a SAFETAG audit, and some reminders of the work you need to have completed before arriving in country.</p>
<h4>Prepare for Uncertainty</h4>
<p>The SAFETAG roadmap is a crisp, clear data flow of inputs to outputs. Reality, generally speaking, is less direct. There are a few core parts of the audit process that force action, but others are more flexible. Outcomes of your discussion and exploration of the network will also de-rail the process in impossible-to-predict ways. The pre-audit interviews and your own contexts research, research on the organization, and preparation are meant to give you the best possible idea of what situation you'll walk in to, but even with all of that, frankly, shit happens.</p>
<p>Before Travel</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreements, Scope, Risk Analysis</li>
<li>Remote Research</li>
<li>Openly sourced data: DNS, MX, Web, research via social media and google</li>
<li>Revealed information via Skype / etc. (office IP address?), nmap</li>
<li>Packing and Prep</li>
<li>Visas / Travel planning</li>
<li>Hardware packing</li>
<li>Software (run updates) and dictionary list prep (local language dictionaries, plus creation of a custom password list based on website keywords, addresses, and dates)</li>
</ul>
<h4>First Day</h4>
<p>Priorities for the first day include meeting staff (even, possibly especially, for the more technical auditor). There is a strong temptation to dive in and get started, but establishing connections with the staff - especially those you haven't met through interviews - is key. You may discover hidden sources of talent or resistance, historical information, and new parts of the infrastructure or practices and policies that you may not have yet found.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet staff, discuss operations and plan interruptions with key staff</li>
<li>In-person discussions of risks, challenges, fears, questions, and experiences around digital security</li>
<li>(If relevant) Attempt to crack wifi without password knowledge</li>
<li>Parallel, collect wifi beacons while not associated to any one network (sending connection resets).</li>
<li>Once wifi password is obtained (through cracking or asking), start a capture of decrypted traffic and run it as long as possible for later analysis</li>
<li>Map out the “visible” network (nmap)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Early steps</h4>
<p>From a data-gathering point of view, the first steps are to try and access the wireless network by password guessing, but also to connect to the network and capture traffic for analysis overnight. This provides other views on the actual technology and services used on the network, different both from the management and IT view as well as other tools discussed by staff.</p>
<p>First or Second day</p>
<ul>
<li>Associate nmap scans, MAC addresses, and beacons with people and specific systems, plus servers/networking hardware</li>
<li>Scans on the captured traffic for passwords, auth cookies, suspicious traffic, unencrypted connections</li>
</ul>
<p>Further Days (on Location) The next day you’re on location, you have hopefully looked through the research data you gathered, and have some specific follow-up things to investigate. It’s also now time to start going through the audit tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeper dive into what hardware is connected and what it is doing</li>
<li>Begin organizing vulnerabilities and tracking against the audit framework</li>
<li>External audit tasks</li>
<li>Internal audit tasks</li>
<li>Physical audit tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Final Day (on Location)</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss initial findings and responses</li>
<li>Suggestions for follow-up training, resources to consult, and possibly targeted trainings for relevant staff (what is a secure password? How to communicate securely?)</li>
<li>Discuss next steps: SAFETAG Report, connections to trainers, how to seek help</li>
</ul>
<h4>Exploration and check-ins</h4>
<p>Throughout the entire audit, aggressively make time to engage with staff - stop for coffee, eat lunch with them, have conversations. This can be integrated in to other parts of the process, such as the user device assessments, as well as being completely independent and natural. Having better connections with staff will make the group exercises, especially the risk assessment work, flow much better.</p>
<p>Whenever you set off a scan (airodumping, nmap, openvas...) are good times to stand up and walk around.</p>
<h4>Debrief and Setting Expectations</h4>
<p>Largely covered in the [debrief section], making time at the end of the (often hectic) audit week is very important to making sure the next few steps are absolutely clear in terms of timelines and communication protocols.</p>
<h4>Clean up</h4>
<p>If you have been using paper or post-it notes during the audit, be sure you securely destroy them (by shredding, burning, or tearing into small pieces) before you leave the site on the last day. By the same token, any digital reports should be stored on secure media and securely deleted from all other locations. See the [operational security] section and per-item notes for further details. Clean off any whiteboards used, and check any camera used to remove sensitive photos.</p>
<h4>Follow up care and Reporting</h4>
<p>See the reporting sections for specific details here, but a series of check-ins with the organization to support their ability to respond to any incidents, understand further topics from the debrief, and to help provide them a timeline to expect the final report is valuable in maintaining their engagement post-audit to support the needed changes.</p>

<p><!-- INTRO to Methods--></p>
<h1 id="safetag-methods">SAFETAG Methods</h1>
<p>These objectives provide collections of approaches and activities to gather and verify information in both technical and interactive/social methods, assess and build capacity, and targeted exercises with walk-through instructions for many of these.</p>
<p>These are not meant to be a &quot;checklist&quot; or even a prescribed set of actions -- indeed, experienced auditors will deviate strongly from many of the specific activities. These provide a focused &quot;minimal set&quot; of activities only.</p>
<p>Indeed, many objectives and their specific exercises overlap or can be done together -- on-site interviews with staff can coincide with assessing their devices and keeping one's eyes open for physical security issues. The data assessment exercises may provide enough information that other staff engagements are unnecessary.</p>
<p><!-- Audit Scoping--></p>
<h2 id="context-research">Context Research</h2>
<h3 id="summary-7">Summary</h3>
<p>This component allows the auditor to identify the relevant regional and technological context needed to provide a safe and informed SAFETAG audit. This component consists of desk research that is collected and analyzed by the auditor, as well as inputs from the Interview component.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-3">Purpose</h3>
<p>Analysis of context is the foundation of effective risk management. Both at-risk organizations and auditors will develop assumptions based upon their experience. It is important that an audit is based on information that is current and accurate.</p>
<p>Checking the assumptions both of the organization and of the auditor by researching the current regional and technological context will ensure that an auditor is basing their work on accurate assessments of the conditions the organization faces and that they are making informed operational security considerations.</p>

<h2 id="capacity-assessment">Capacity Assessment</h2>
<h3 id="summary-10">Summary</h3>
<p>In this component the auditor engages with staff through interviews and conversations to identify the organization's strengths and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) to adopting new digital and physical security practices. The auditor uses this information to modify the audit scope and recommendations accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-4">Purpose</h3>
<p>Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses allows the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve. The auditor will use this assessment in preparing for the audit itself as well as when evaluating the difficulty of a recommendation. This information also provides a starting place for understanding the organization's current use and understanding of technology, digital security, and current threat landscape, as well as revealing elements of an organization's workflow, infrastructure and even vulnerabilities that you might otherwise have overlooked.</p>

<h4>Interviews</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>The auditor conducts interviews with various staff members to gather information on the organizations risks and capacity.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A sessions are unabashedly <em>white box</em> aspects of a security assessment, and you will occasionally hear push-back along the lines of, &quot;You wouldn't have found that thing if we hadn't told you about this other thing.&quot; Compelling <em>black box</em> findings certainly do have an advantage when it comes to persuasiveness, but obtaining them can be quite time-consuming, so relying exclusively on vulnerabilities that you can identify without &quot;help&quot; is generally a mistake in this resource-constrained sector.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Set up secure channels for communication</li>
<li>Interview managerial staff</li>
<li>Interview technical staff</li>
<li>Use the Categories (at the end of the sample interview questions) to help scope which questions to ask</li>
<li>Use the Capacity Assessment Cheat-Sheet to track topics you have covered</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>If the auditor or organization believes that there is a good chance of surveillance on the channel you are communicating over, do the rest of the interview on a secured channel or in person where possible, though some information-gathering is critical to do before planning the audit. Inability to do so contributes towards a no-go situation.</li>

<h4>Capacity Assessment Checklist</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>A monolithic, one-time interview with key staff is not always possible or advisable, but interacting with a variety of staff exposes valuable information about every aspect of the audit, from vulnerabilities to capacity to hidden barriers. This serves as a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; of some topics to explore both during the planning and preparation phase and throughout the audit process.</p>

<h2 id="reconnaissance">Reconnaissance</h2>
<h3 id="summary-13">Summary</h3>
<p>The remote assessment methodology focuses on direct observation of an organization and their infrastructure, consisting of passive reconnaissance of publicly available data sources (&quot;Open Source Intelligence&quot;) This allows the auditor to identify publicly available resources (such as websites, extranets, email servers, but also social media information) connected to the organization and remotely gather information about those resources.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-5">Purpose</h3>
<p>While much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around the office, unintended information available from &quot;open sources&quot; can pose real threats and deserve significant attention. This also builds the Auditor's understanding of the organization's digital presence and will guide specific vulnerabilities to investigate once on site.</p>

<h4>Manual Reconnaissance</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This exercise suggests some targeted online search tools and tricks to gather information leakages from organizations. While many advocacy, activism, and media/journalism focused organizations are very public as part of their operations, the searches suggested here aim to explore data that could be used to better attack or socially engineer an organization.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use advanced search tools of major search engines to discover partners, projects, and other valuable information about the organization.</li>
<li>Social Media / Account Discovery</li>
<li>Search pastebin and github style sites for breach and website/software development records</li>
<li>Use reverse image searching and exif tools on photos of interest</li>
<li>Use to add additional data in to, and to research further discoveries from, the automated recon work</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use VPNs or Tor to conduct your searching. Tor may be blocked by some services.</li>
<li>Some searches may reveal personal information. Be empathetic and responsible with this, even though it is &quot;public&quot; information.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>These custom and more manual approaches work excellently in combination with automated tools such as recon-ng or the commercial Maltego. Working with both these tricks and the automated tools, feeding information learned from one back to the other, is a powerful way to unearth large amounts of information about an organization.</p>
<p>Much of the tools and further guidance is well covered in the references for the Reconnaissance method, a small selection of starting points is mapped out below.</p>
<p>Take care, however, to not waste time on this; using image information tools on every photo on an organization's website, or researching every linked social media account may not provide further valuable information - step back and judge the value of digging deeper - are you finding adversaries? Are you finding information that the organization may not want online? Are there other methods which might be more appropriate to apply?</p>
<h5>Search Engines</h5>
<p>Google dorking tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>limit to the target webiste using site: and look for potentially accidentally uploaded file types (e.g. xlsx, you can reference this <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en">full list of searchable filetypes</a>)</li>
<li>inurl:</li>
<li>search for link: to discover partners and projects (add &quot;project of&quot; and similar), removing known, un-interesting and irrelevant sites with -site:</li>
<li>Browse <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/">Exploit-db</a> for interesting and advanced combinations to consider, e.g. inurl:/wp-en/wpbackitup_backups</li>
</ul>
<h5>Social Media / Account Discovery</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use tools such as <a href="http://knowem.com/checksocialnames.php">KnowEm</a>, <a href="https://namechk.com/">namechk</a>, or <a href="http://www.namechecklist.com/">namechecklist</a> to find similar or organizationally-linked usernames across other social media accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Additional Tools</h5>
<ul>
<li>GlassDoor can provide insight (mostly for larger organizations) on whether there might be disgruntled former (or current) employees.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Pastebin Searching</h5>
<ul>
<li>Search pastebin for keywords about the organization (usually their website address) -- this <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse/home?cx=001580308195336108602:mhdmrvbspnm">custom google search</a> by <a href="http://inteltechniques.com/OSINT/pastebins.html">IntelTechniques</a> searches across over 100 pastebin-like sites, including github, at once.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Working with Images</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use tools like <a href="https://tineye.com/">tineye</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en">Google Reverse Image search</a> to find images (especially user icons from twitter, etc.) on other sites, and test interesting ones for additional image in the EXIF data using online tools like <a href="http://regex.info/exif.cgi">Exif Viewer</a> or commandline tools like <code>exiftool</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automated Reconnaisance</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This component allows the auditor to quickly identify publicly available resources (such as websites, extranets, email servers, but also social media information) connected to the organization and remotely gather information about those resources.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Passive Reconnaissance
<ul>
<li>Identify availability of staff, partner, beneficiary, and current project information online. <a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></li>
<li>Search &quot;paste-bin&quot; sites for leaked internal information or existing exploitation of their infrastructure.</li>
<li>Create API keys for Recon-ng services to be used. <a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></li>
<li>Use recon-ng to do automated web-based open source reconnaissance. <a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use VPNs to do automated searching. The automated process can be misconstrued by various services as malicious and cause your local network to get blocked, filtered, or surveilled. Tor is often blocked by the tools you will be using.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>See the Appendix for a full walk-through of using recon-ng</p>

<h4>Mail Exchange Record Search</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>MX, or Mail Exchange, records are required to be public for any domain you wish to receive email through. These records can still reveal sensitive information about your hosting set-up.</p>
<p>MX Records can reveal vulnerable mail servers or information about other services hosted internally.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Determine an organization's email services.</li>
<li>Explore any potential vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>MX Record research reveals self-hosted email server at SampleOrg’s offices:</p>
<p>mail.sample.org has address 256.0.0.3</p>
<p>Determine the authoritative name server(s) for the organization’s</p>
<p>primary domain:</p>
<pre><code>root@bt:~# host -t mx sample.org
sample.org mail is handled by 21 mail.sample.org</code></pre>
<p>Determine the IP address of the mail server:</p>
<pre><code>root@bt:~# host mail.sample.org
mail.sample.org has address 256.0.0.3</code></pre>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>No fix needed</p>
<p>Unless other assessments reveals specific vulnerabilities in e-mail services used, there is no action to take. Unless you have sufficient in-house expertise, it is often recommended to not host email servers. While self-hosted email provides more control and potentially security, managing the security of the server is a complex job. Other mail services, such as MailControl or Postini, also can provide some level of protection by being a first-pass check for spam and viruses, and (slightly) reducing the visibility of your organizational mail server.</p>
</div>
<div class="boxtext">
<h4>Anonymous DNS Zone Transfer</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Anonymous individuals online can request the full list of the hostnames on the organizations domain. Responding to zone requests from anyone on the Internet is comparable to providing an inventory of office locations, pending projects and service providers to anyone who asks. As such, it is not inherently dangerous, but it does require that the organization not rely on the assumption that unpublicized URLs are in fact secret.</p>
<p>An overly permissive domain name service (DNS) provider allows an attacker to enumerate online services that the organization might think are “hidden” because they have not been (intentionally) published. A zone transfer returns all of the hostnames at a particular domain, or “zone.” So, a request for sample.org may return www.sample.org, webmail.sample.org and ftp.sample.org, along with other less obviously guessable targets, such as wordpress-testing.sample.org.</p>
<p>While any user should be able to use a name server to look up a hostname and convert it to the corresponding IP address, most well-administered name servers allow full “zone transfer” requests only from a specific list of authorized locations (often themselves subsidiary name servers).</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>Determine the authoritative name server(s) for the organization’s primary domain:</p>
<pre><code>$ host -t ns sample.org
sample.org name server ns1.something.net.
sample.org name server ns2.something.net.</code></pre>
<p>Attempt a zone transfer on that domain, using that name server:</p>
<pre><code>$ host -l sample.org ns1.something.net
Using domain server:
Name: ns1.something.net
Address: 256.0.0.1#53
Aliases: 

www.sample.org has address 256.0.0.2
mail.sample.org has address 256.0.0.3
webmail.sample.org has address 256.0.0.4
ftp.sample.org has address 256.0.0.5
foo.sample.org has address 256.0.0.6
bar.sample.org has address 256.0.0.7</code></pre>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p><strong>Eliminate or limit zone transfer permissions</strong></p>
<p>The DNS provider for sample.org allows anonymous DNS zone transfers, revealing subdomain information</p>
<p>An anonymous zone transfer request revealed the following subdomains:</p>
<pre><code>www.sample.org has address 256.0.0.2
mail.sample.org has address 256.0.0.3
webmail.sample.org has address 256.0.0.4
ftp.sample.org has address 256.0.0.5
foo.sample.org has address 256.0.0.6</code></pre>
<p>In most cases, the DNS Zone Transfer policies will be set by your domain name provider; and most providers automatically limit anonymous zone transfers. If yours does not, you will need to work with their support team to prevent this, or switch to a different DNS provider.</p>
<p>If your organization maintains its own DNS servers, the administrator of those servers should check the zone transfer policies to prevent anonymous transfers.</p>

<p><!-- Network Discovery--></p>
<h2 id="network-discovery">Network Discovery</h2>
<h3 id="summary-18">Summary</h3>
<p>This component allows the auditor to show the &quot;visibility&quot; of an organization's wireless network and identify devices using that network. This component consists of wireless scanning, device identification, and wireless signal mapping.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-6">Purpose</h3>
<p>The value of the network discovery component depends on the risk assessment of the organization. In many cases, an organization may not want the name of their wireless network to be associated with to their organization.</p>
<p>Device beacons are also of interest, as they can reveal organizational links, as well as travel, favorite hotspots, and more. Beacons can &quot;de-anonymize&quot; an obfuscated network name as well as provide rich content for social engineering attacks. This provides an only-lightly-invasive introduction to discuss the trackability of devices, particularly mobiles and laptops.</p>
<p>Wireless networks are often trusted as equivalent to the hardwired office networks they have largely replaced, but they have important differences. Wireless networks are often &quot;visible&quot; from outside the walls of the office - from common spaces or even the street. Without further access, this step along reveals a wealth of information about the organization's size and the type of devices connecting to their network.</p>

<h4>Monitor Open Wireless Traffic</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Each wireless device maintains a &quot;memory&quot; of what networks it has successfully connected to. When it is connecting to a network, it sends out &quot;probes&quot; to all of the networks it has in this memory. These probes can reveal personal, organizational, and locational information that, taken in context, can be dangerous or lead to other vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this data gets broadcast widely, and can be collected without any network access, only proximity to the device. Description</p>
<p>Before attempting to gain internal access to the wireless network, it can be valuable to to listen to the wireless traffic as close to the physical office location as possible, even without knowing anything about the network itself. This outside, passive information gathering can reveal a surprising amount of data on not only what devices are connecting to which networks, but also what type of devices they are (based on their unique MAC addresses), and what other networks those devices have historically connected to.</p>
<p>These network probes can often contain names (especially from mobile phone tethers), organizational affiliations, and a mixture of other potentially valuable data (home network names, recent airports, cafés and conference networks). If there are many networks in the office's vicinity, this will help identify the specific office network (if there is any doubt).</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Monitor wireless network traffic</li>
<li>Discover the organization's network</li>
<li>Track &quot;beacons&quot; and MAC addresses of attached devices</li>
<li>Capture a wifi handshake if intending to use the Network Access methodology</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<h5>Step 1: Monitor Mode</h5>
<p>You should disconnect from any wifi network you may be connected to to capture the widest amount of data.</p>
<p>Switch your wireless adapter to monitor mode**</p>
<p><code>$ airmon-ng start &lt;interface&gt;</code></p>
<p>You may need to stop your network manager system to prevent it from interfering. Running</p>
<p><code>$ airmon-ng check</code></p>
<p>to list anything that is causing problems, and</p>
<p><code>$ airmon-ng check kill</code></p>
<p>to try and stop them automatically, and running stop network-manager &amp;&amp; stop avahi-daemon may keep them from re-starting automatically.</p>
<h5>Step 2: Listen for wifi probes.</h5>
<p>Run airodump-ng on the monitor mode interface (usually mon0). This listens to wifi beacons and you can begin analyzing who is on what network, and see historical networks.</p>
<p><strong>Leave this running in a separate window for the duration of your visit.</strong></p>
<p><code>airodump-ng -w filename mon0</code></p>
<p>This scans all networks and channels, collecting broadcast network information. Note that, despite its broadcast nature, this is privacy invasive and can be considered illegal: http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/16/google_street_view_wi_fi_snooping_case_good_news_and_bad_news.html . You can restict this to a specific channel or base station ID (BSSID) with -c and --bssid:</p>
<p><code>airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w filename mon0</code></p>
<h5>Step 3: de-auth</h5>
<p>Send de-authentication packets to force clients to reconnect and send out additional probes. Take note that by its very nature, de-authentication causes annoying interruptions to wifi traffic. This breaks connections, drops skype calls, and can make the wireless network temporarily unusable. Make sure to check with staff before going through this (to make sure no one is doing a live webcast or on an important VOIP call, and to expect some network instability).</p>
<pre><code>$ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF mon0 

 15:54:48  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 00:11:22:33:44:55) on channel 1
 15:54:49  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF] [ 5| 3 ACKs]</code></pre>
<p>This command de-authenticates one targeted user with one attempted deauth packet. &quot;-0 10&quot; would try 10 times (potentially disconnecting the user multiple times!). With permission, you can also target all users on a network by leaving out the &quot;-c ...&quot; flag.</p>
<p>There are scripts, like wifijammer, which use this same approach to jam <em>all</em> wifi connections in range of the attacking computer, so check against the documentation at http://www.aircrack-ng.org and act responsibly to protect yourself and the organization.</p>
<h5>Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring</h5>
<p>Watch what probes the various devices are sending out (especially when they are deauthenticated, as above). You will see each computer on the network, as identified by their mac addresses, broadcast information about previous networks to which they have connected.</p>
<pre><code>BSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost    Frames Probe

<h3 id="summary-21">Summary</h3>
<p>This component allows the auditor to test the strength of defenses the host has in place to protect their local area network. This component consists of gaining access to the local area network through a wireless access point and unsecured physical channels (such as an ethernet jack).</p>
<h3 id="purpose-7">Purpose</h3>
<p>By walking organizations through the vulnerabilities of wireless networks, you have the opportunity to discuss password strength, and the power that having &quot;offline&quot; access to a password means in terms of brute forcing it, as well as the importance of defense in depth even within their trusted work network - reducing the services computers and servers are sharing, setting up local firewalls on computers, and requiring authentication to access files.</p>
<p>Even a few minutes of network &quot;sniffing&quot; by an adversary can enable them to work offline to reveal the network password. Knowing this password would let someone then access the entire internal network, files shared internally, and even change network settings to enable remote access. While in an ideal setup, this would give no further access to sensitive documents, it is not uncommon to find shared file folders, or to gain access to the firewall or network routers (often set to the default password, because they're only accessible from inside the network...).</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> This section is one of the few sections where the SAFETAG audit does go through attack scenarios, from attempting to &quot;break in&quot; to the wireless network to testing exposed ethernet jacks for connectivity.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are threefold. First, access to an organization's internal network tends to reveal sensitive data and &quot;shadow&quot; infrastructures (such as dropbox usage) that lead to many recommendations to improve access control and discussions of the value of defense in depth. Second, the specific act of breaking the wifi password allows for a discussion on password security without attacking any specific user's password. Finally, with wireless networks treated as equivalent to wired networks in many offices, reminding the organization that wireless networks extend beyond the physical walls of the office is useful in discussing password rotation and guest network policies.</p>
<p>Once you have access to the network, you need to first document how you managed that and share it with the hosts. This is a great moment to discuss passwords in many cases.</p>

<h4>WPA Password Cracking</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>The organization’s wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) protects the network and its users with WPA encryption. This is an important security measure, and a WPA-protected wireless network is much safer than an unencrypted “open” network or a WEP-protected network. (WEP is fundamentally flawed, and extremely simple attacks have been widely known for over a decade.) However, the ease with an attacker could guess the WPA key, or “WiFi password,” is a serious issue, particularly considering its importance as an essential perimeter control. An attacker who gains access to the wireless LAN immediately bypasses many protections that network administrators, and other users of the office network, often take for granted. Put another way, anyone able to guess the WPA key is immediately “inside the firewall.”</p>
<p>Using a laptop and a wireless card with a standard, internal antenna (or using a customized smartphone or other small device), an attacker could easily position themselves close enough to the office to carry out the first phase of this attack, which would only take a few minutes. The second phase, which is supposed to be the difficult part, could take even less time. From the privacy of their own home or office, the attacker could use a minimally customized password dictionary to guess the WPA key .</p>
<!--For reporting, needs time-to-break WPA password -->

<h5>Overview</h5>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>For the (most common) WPA password-based attacks, an already-prepared dictionary of words to use to attack the password will be required. See the Appendix on Audit Preparation for guidance on dictionary preparation.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>An attacker can crack the office’s WPA key in approximately with a short and minimally customized password dictionary based on open information about the organization and basic word collections.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The attacker customizes their WiFi password dictionary, adding phrases related to the subject: organization name, street address, phone number, email domain, wireless network name, etc. Common password fragments are included, as well: qwerty, 12345, asdf and all four-digit dates back to the year 2001, for example, among others. He may then add hundreds or thousands of words (in English and/or other relevant languages).</p>
<p>See the Dictionary Creation example under Preparation for details on password dictionary buidling.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The attacker would then begin recording all (encrypted) wireless traffic associated with the organization’s access point:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F -w sampleorg_airodump mon0

<p>wifite is also useful for this step, and claims to automatically de-auth (step 3).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, the auditor forces a wireless client, possibly chosen at random, to disconnect and reconnect (an operation that is nearly always invisible to the user).</p>
<p>In the example below, AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF is the MAC address of a laptop that was briefly disconnected in this way.</p>
<pre><code>$ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F -c AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF mon0 

 15:54:48  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F) on channel -1
 15:54:49  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF] [ 5| 3 ACKs]</code></pre>
<p>The goal of this step is to capture the cryptographic handshake that occurs when the targeted client reconnects. Try using different clients if the first one doesn't work, or try (physically) moving around.</p>
<p>This handshake does not contain the WPA key itself, but once the the complete handshake process has been seen, the auditor (or a potential attacker) can leave the vicinity and run various password cracking tools to try and discover the password. While a complete password cracking tutorial is out of scope for SAFETAG documentation, below are three strategies:</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The auditor attempts to discover the WPA password.</p>
<p>A good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break an unforunate number of passwords. Using a collection of all english words, all words from the language of the organization being audited, plus a combination of all these words, plus relevant keywords, addresses, and years tends to crack most wifi passwords.</p>

<p>For WPA captures, John can either feed in to an aircrack process or attack a capture directly. For captures, you first have to convert the .cap file (from wireshark, wifite, airodump, etc.) to a format that John likes. The Jumbo version we use has conversion tools for this available:</p>

<p>The fourth line of the above output provides some useful information about the effectiveness of a strong WPA key. That rate of approximately 2000 keys per second means that a full-on, brute-force attack against a similar-length key that was truly random (and therefore immune to dictionary-based attacks) would take about 70^9 or 20 trillion seconds, which is well over 600,000 years. Or, for those who favor length and simplicity over brevity and complexity, a key containing four words chosen from among the 10,000 most common English dictionary words would still take approximately 150,000 years to crack (using this method on an average laptop).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that an attacker with the resources and the expertise could increase this rate by a factor of a hundred. Using a computer with powerful graphical processing units (GPUs) or a cloud computing service like Amazon’s EC2, it is possible to test 250,000 or more keys per second. A setup like this would still take several lifetimes to guess a strong password, however.</p>
<p>Regardless, the success of this attack against a wireless network would allow an attacker to bypass all perimeter controls, including the network firewall. Without access to the office LAN, a non-ISP, non-government attacker would have to position himself on the same network as an external staff member in order to exploit any flaws in the organization’s email or file-sharing services. With access to the local network, however, that attacker could begin carrying out Local attacks quite quickly, and from a distance.</p>
<p>With regard to the distance from which an attacker could maintain such access, the office WiFi network appears to have a relatively strong signal, which extends to the street out front:</p>

<h4>WPS PIN Cracking</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>WPS was built as an addition to WPA to make it easier to add devices without typing in secure passwords, but this ease of use means that a malicious actor can pose as a device and effectively reduce the potentially very difficult passwords WPA allows down to a simple numeric-only 8 character PIN. Further, the WPS system allows an attacker to work on this PIN in two parallel chunks, further reducing its security. This, like WEP, is a &quot;live&quot; attack - you have to stay connected to the network - but also like WEP, it is a guaranteed attack; your brute forcing of the WPS system will eventually (2-10 hours) allow you network access.</p>

WPS Pin entry should be disabled on the wireless router, or only enabled temporarily to add new devices to the network.

<div class="boxtext">
<h4>WEP Password Cracking</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>WEP provides no effective protection for a wifi network. Most wifi routers offer WPA encryption as an option, and if this is available it should be immediately implemented. Some older routers (and wifi devices) do not support WPA. It is highly recommended to upgrade immediately to hardware that supports WPA and to eliminate all WEP network access.</p>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>The auditor can be guaranteed to access a WEP network with sufficient time by cracking the WEP key.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the wireless interface in monitor mode on the specific AP channel</li>
<li>Use aireplay-ng to do a fake authentication with the access point</li>
<li>Start airodump-ng on AP channel with a bssid filter to collect the new unique IVs</li>
<li>Start aireplay-ng in ARP request replay mode to inject packets</li>
<li>Run aircrack-ng to crack key using the IVs collected</li>

<h4>Accessing a MAC-filtered Network</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Open and MAC-address-filtered wireless access points are not only open to anyone within range to join and listen in to, but also do not provide protection to those on the network itself, even if they do not &quot;broadcast&quot; their name.

<h2 id="network-mapping">Network Mapping</h2>
<h3 id="summary-26">Summary</h3>
<p>This component allows the auditor to identify the devices on a host's network, the services that are being used by those devices, and any protections in place.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-8">Purpose</h3>
<p>Mapping an organization's network exposes the multitude of devices connected to it -- including mostly forgotten servers -- and provides the baseline for later work on device assessment and vulnerability research.</p>
<p>This process also reveals outside service usage (such as google services, dropbox, or others) which serve -- intentionally or not -- as shadow infrastructure for the organization. In combination with beacon research from the network discovery process, many devices can be associated with users.</p>

<h4>Network Scanning</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Local networks often have a variety of devices connected to them - servers, user devices, staff cellphones, and more. Scanning the connected devices can reveal potential areas for further research (odd ports being open, out of date devices/services, forgotten servers/services...).</p>
<p>Selected scanning of external network devices (websites, webmail, extranet services) may also reveal vulnerabilities or other areas of concern.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Scan the network for all connected devices</li>
<li>Review device information and open services for potential vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Using beacons and other data, map devices to users.</li>
<li>Scan select external services (particularly self-hosted webmail/email servers and other extranet services) to detect possible unencrypted but sensitive connection possibilities</li>
<li>Enumerate shared directories on the network and check for access controls</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>Using a network scanning tool (<strong>nmap/zenmap</strong> work well), discover the devices connected to the organization's network, and explore further information such as services, service banners, and operating systems. More intense scans can be too time-consuming to run across the entire network, so target those to higher value systems. As always, be aware of the scans and additional scripts you choose, and focus your exploration (in nmap) on scripts categorized as &quot;safe&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover network-connected devices, including servers and workstations, but also smartphones, voip phones, and other devices.</li>
<li>Open ports</li>
<li>OS detection</li>
<li>banners (not all ports corectly map to their &quot;expected&quot; services, also provides service version information)</li>
<li>additional Scripts and more exhaustive port scanning as needed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Service research</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect all systems providing internal services to the host organization.
<ul>
<li>Record the version and patch levels of software on the device. <a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></li>
<li>Identify weak ports or services available under the current device's firewall configuration. <a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></li>
<li>Identify all odd/obscure/one-off services. <a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using the list of software versions and patches identify attacks and, if possible, identified malware that devices in the office are vulnerable to.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SMB Network tools</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>smbtree</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shared Folders Enumeration</strong></p>
<p>Unsigned NTLM authentication messages vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attack on SMB file servers</p>
<p>Unsigned NTLM authentication messages allow an attacker on the LAN to add, remove or copy files to and from the organization’s file servers (and workstations with filesharing enabled).</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>While office networks are often treated as &quot;trusted&quot; spaces, measures should be in place to reduce the potential harm of an attacker who gains access. In addition, devices that &quot;travel&quot; -- such as laptops and mobile phones -- should have adequate security settings (generally, firewalls) to protect them on other networks.</p>
A policy should be in place for connecting personal devices to work networks, as well as work devices to non-work networks.

<div class="boxtext">
<h4>Network Traffic Analysis</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Any content that is sent out over the network without encryption is easy to intercept; this includes email, web passwords, and chat messages.</p>
<p>This attacker could be someone, such as a patron of the Internet cafe where a staff member is working, who just happens to be using the same local network to connect to the Internet. Or, she could work for an organization with privileged access to the relevant network, such as the Internet Service Provider (ISP) of either the sender or receiver and other network-backbone connections made along the way.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Intercept network traffic</li>
<li>Review it for security concerns</li>
<li>Watch for unencrypted email (POP/SMTP/IMAP) connections, unencrypted website logins (for blogs, websites, and webmail in particular)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>Wifi device and drivers supporting &quot;promiscuous mode&quot; (see http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible_cards&amp;DokuWiki=a36042531edb54f9b95a76ff61d77d14)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Treat captured network traffic with the utmost security and empathetic responsibility. They may contain very personal data, passwords, and more. These should not be shared except in specific, intentional samples with anyone, including the organization itself.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<h5>Network Traffic Interception</h5>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The attacker tricks the victim into routing all of his traffic through the attacker’s machine. This involves making a simple request to the victim’s IP address, which is not difficult to do. Computers are rarely configured to ignore such requests.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh -c &#39;echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward&#39;

$ sudo arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.99 192.168.1.1</code></pre>
<p>Sample Output:</p>
<pre><code>00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55
...
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, only a single victim (192.168.1.99) is being targeted, but the attack works fine against multiple victims, or even against the entire network. In other words, the attacker does not need to know which IP address (on the office or Internet cafe LAN, for example) belongs to her target. Furthermore, the victim is extremely unlikely to notice any sign that this phase of the attack is taking place.</p>
<p>EtterCap provides a powerful frontend to managing this process with multiple potential targets. In EtterCap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the &quot;Sniff&quot; menu, select &quot;Unified sniffing&quot; (for most cases where you are using one interface to both intercept and forward traffic), and select the relevant interface (wlan0)</li>
<li>Under the Hosts menu, select the systems on the network you will target, or leave blank to target all systems</li>
<li>Under Mitm, select &quot;arp spoofing&quot; for this example</li>
<li>Select &quot;Start&quot; under the Sniffing menu</li>
</ul>
<p><Ettercap Screenshot></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> At this point, if the attacker is looking for unencrypted traffic, all she needs to do is launch a packet-sniffer, such as Wireshark, and scan through the intercepted traffic for specific vulnerable information, such as email or website logins, as well as traffic revealing shadow infrastructure usage, such as Dropbox.</p>
<p><Wireshark screenshot></p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>Only use services with <a href="https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication">&quot;SSL&quot; encryption</a> (&quot;HTTPS&quot;), and consider adding <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> to browsers. This does not itself guarantee protection from all attacks, but it is a good first-step in protecting information (such as passwords or email) in transit from your computer to the service provider.</p>

<h4>Device and Software Version Assessment</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus and other security capabilities, and identifies software runing on computers and its current version. The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any out of date software.</p>
<p>This is used to develop a report component exposing how un-updated software can lead to large vulnerabilities.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Identify what privilege level services are running under -- Are users using accounts with admin privelges, or are they using another user and have to type in a password to get admin rights? <a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></li>
<li>Check for existence and status of anti-virus (and anti-malware tools) on the device. <a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></li>
<li>Record the version and patch levels of software on the device. <a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></li>
<li>Identify what level of encryption is being used and is available for data storage on the device. <a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></li>
<li>Using the list of software versions and patches identify attacks and, if possible, identified malware that devices in the office are vulnerable to.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>A notepad may be useful</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e. explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in aggregate.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>The auditor inspects a subset of key and/or representative user devices (work &amp; personal). The auditor should focus on the work devices to limit scope creep, but if the office has many personal devices accessing organizational accounts/data, the auditor should share what &quot;red flags&quot; they are looking for and work in tandem with device owners and/or IT staff. For a small office, it may be possible to check every machine. For larger offices, the auditor should use a subset to get a feel for the overall security stance of user devices.</p>
<p>See the Appendix for a per-OS guide of where to find key data.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<h5>Upgrade Operating Systems</h5>
<p>Popular operating systems like Windows XP are, sadly, no longer receiving security updates.</p>
<h5>Move to Licensed Operating Systems</h5>
<p>While &quot;pirated&quot; operating systems are extremely common (especially Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of security. If the OS is not receiving regular updates from the software creator, it is extremely vulnerable to thousands of potential attacks.</p>
<h5>Update Operating Systems</h5>
<p>Operating Systems of all varieties - Windows, Mac, Linux, and others, are constantly being updated. These updates often fix bugs, but they also protect the system from newly discovered vulnerabilities. It can seem difficult to keep updating constantly, but this is very important to protect even non-sensitive systems.</p>
<h5>Update Vulnerable Software</h5>
<p>Many critical software components, such as Java or Adobe Flash, have many vulnerabilities and need to be aggressively updated.</p>
<h5>Install Anti-Virus</h5>
<h5>Move to Licensed Anti-Virus</h5>
<h5>Update Anti-Virus</h5>
<p>Most AV tools automatically update, but this can sometimes get out of sync, or if the AV was a pre-installed trial system, it will stop updating after its trial period. An out of date anti-virus is worthless.</p>
<h5>Install Anti-Malware scanner</h5>
<h5>Encrypt Hard Drives</h5>
<h5>Activate a personal firewall</h5>

<p>The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus and other security capabilities, and identifies software runing on computers and its current version. The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any out of date software.</p>
<p>This is used to develop a report component exposing how un-updated software can lead to large vulnerabilities.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Integrated with other activities/interactions, interview staff on their usage of technology and remote services</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e. explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in aggregate.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>As you work with staff members (this pairs well with the device checklist activity), also interview them about the other devices they use, and how they connect to work services - email/webmail, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, and website management tools.</p>
<h5>Phone Usage</h5>
<ul>
<li>Work Email</li>
<li>Work Calls</li>
<li>Chat Apps with partners/work related</li>
</ul>
<h5>User Software and Tools</h5>
<ul>
<li>Email software</li>
<li>Calendars</li>
<li>Shared Files inside the office</li>
<li>Other shared file systems</li>
<li>Chat</li>
<li>Voice calls</li>
<li>Program tracking software</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Progress</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>intranet</li>
<li>extranet / other sites?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Remote Services</h5>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Work Email</li>
<li>Websites and blogs</li>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>Online CRM or mass-mailing tools (SalesForce, CiviCRM, MailChimp...)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
Only use services with <a href="https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication">&quot;SSL&quot; encryption</a> (&quot;HTTPS&quot;), and consider adding <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> to browsers. This does not itself guarantee protection from all attacks, but it is a good first-step in protecting information (such as passwords or email) in transit from your computer to the service provider.

<h4>Firewire Access to Encrypted/Locked computers</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Firewire ports and expansion slots can be abused to obtain data that are thought to be encrypted</p>
<p>Any attacker who obtains a running (including sleeping and hibernating!) Windows, Mac, or even Linux laptop with a Firewire port, an ExpressCard expansion slot, or a Thunderbolt port will be able to read, record or modify any sensitive information on the device, even if the screen is “locked” and the information is stored on an encrypted volume or in an encrypted folder. This applies to threats involving loss, theft and confiscation, but also to “checkpoint” scenarios in which the attacker may only have access for a few minutes.</p>
<p>This attack requires physical control of a machine that is not powered off. Full details of the scope of the attack are available at http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/ .</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>A system with a firewire port, a thunderbolt port, or a PCMCIA slot and a firewire card. See http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/#Requirements</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>Firewire ports and expansion slots can be abused to obtain data that are thought to be encrypted</p>
<p>The threat describe in this section is more complex than it needs to be. In fact, unencrypted data are vulnerable to any number of simple attacks, the two most straightforward being: 1) rebooting the computer from a USB stick CD-ROM or DVD containing an alternate operating system, then copying all of the data; or 2) removing the hard drive, inserting it into a different machine, then copying all of the data. These techniques, which work on nearly any computer, even if a strong login password has been set, are effective and widely used, but they require extended physical access to the device. A slightly different attack is described below, one that only requires physical access for a few minutes. It, too, works regardless of login/screen-lock passwords, though only devices with Firewire ports or expansion slots (ExpressCard, CardBus, PCMCIA, etc.) are vulnerable.</p>
<p>The steps required to defend against all of these threats is the same: encrypt your data using a tool like Microsoft’s BitLocker, Apple’s FileVaule or the open-source Truecrypt application. The Firewire attack highlighted here is particularly illustrative, however, because it serves as a reminder that merely setting up an encrypted volume is not enough. In much the same way that a lock does little to protect your home if the door to which it is attached remains open, data encryption is rarely effective while you are logged into your computer. Even if the screen is locked (which would foil the “reboot” and “hard drive removal” attacks described briefly above), an attacker may still find a way to access your sensitive data, while the computer is up and running, because the decryption key is present in the computer’s memory. (This is how large-scale encryption actually works. Information remains encrypted at all times, on the storage device where it lives, but you are able to access it while you are logged in, or while your encrypted volume is “open,” because your computer decrypts and encrypts it on the fly.) Walkthrough</p>
<p>Step 1: First, the attacker would connect her computer to the victim’s using a Firewire cable. Either or both machines could be using a true Firewire port or a Firewire expansion card. When a Firewire ExpressCard expansion card is inserted, Windows automatically installs and configures the necessary drivers, even if nobody is logged into the laptop.</p>
<p>Step 2: Once connected, the attacker simply runs the Inception tool, selects the operating system of the target machine and waits a minute or two for the attack to complete (depending on the amount of RAM present):</p>
<pre><code>$ incept

<p><em>In the case of the laptops tested, Inception took approximately two minutes to reach the final, somewhat self-congratulatory line shown above. At that point, we were able to login using any password. (Entering “asdf” worked just fine, and gave us full access to all data on the computer.) Inception works by temporarily replacing authentication code using the Firewire’s protocol’s direct memory access (DMA). After a reboot, everything is restored to its original state.</em></p>
<p>Once again, it is worth noting that successful mitigation of this issue requires a combination of technology (data encryption) and some level of behavior change (shutting down laptops at the end of the day, when traveling and at any time when confiscation, theft, loss or tampering are particularly likely.)</p>

<h4>Password Security Survey</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<h3>Weak Passwords</h3>
<p>Weak and &quot;shared&quot; passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of well-publicized global password breaches, &quot;password&quot; and &quot;12345&quot; remain the most popular passwords. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Using the password survey, determine the organization's baseline for password security</li>
<li>If relevant, test the wireless network's password strength</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>For the (most common) WPA password-based attacks, an already-prepared dictionary of words to use to attack the password will be required. See the Appendix on Audit Preparation for guidance on dictionary preparation.</li>
<li>A Password Survey (see Appendix) for an alternate way to gather password practices</li>
<li>The Level Up Activity, <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/activity/password-reverse-race">Password Reverse Race</a> provides a staff activity.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>This exercise supports the auditor in building an effective dictionary that is customized to an organization.</p>
<p>This dictionary can then be used in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By using the examples referenced in the Network Access section, the auditor can attack weak wifi passwords, which present a non-personal and non-disruptive way to demonstrate password security problems. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.</li>
<li>An Auditor can show or discuss their preferred customization strategy and the tools (like JtR) that automatically &quot;mutate&quot; passwords with numbers, capitals, and so on, to demnonstrate the power of a computer to quickly get around common &quot;tricks&quot;</li>
<li>An Auditor can also use a password &quot;survey&quot; to get an understanding of password practices within the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Walkthrough</h4>
<p>This skillset, plus demonstration against non-invasive accounts, provides an opening for a discussion with staff on password security. See <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/secure-passwords">Level Up</a> for further activities and exercises around passwords.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download basic word lists</li>
<li>Research dictionary needs</li>
<li>Create custom word list</li>
<li>Build core list(s)</li>
<li>Attack a password hash using increasingly more time-consuming methods</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>This component provides resources and recommendations on cracking passwords - both the creation of dictionaries and rules to modify those dictionaries, as well as some basic implementation as well. This is a dangerous (and in many cases, illegal) skill to use, and should be more of a guide to auditors on what password security myths do not work against modern password cracking software, and to use only with permission and only in very specific situations as a demonstration of the power of even a common laptop against weak passwords.</p>
<p>Primarily for use in the Network Access component, building a password dictionary, understanding the ways to automatically mutate it, and running it against passwords is a useful skill to have, and to use to explain why simple passwords are insecure. This <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/">Ars Technica article</a> provides a good insight into the path to tackle iterative password cracking using a variety of tools to meet different goals.</p>
<p>These instructions use a small set of password cracking tools, but many are possible. If there are tools you are more familiar or comfortable with using, these by no means are required. The only constraints are to be respectful and responsible, as well as keeping focused on the overall goals and not getting bogged down.</p>
<p>A good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break most passwords. Using a collection of all English words, all words from the language of the organization being audited, plus a combination of all these words, plus relevant keywords, addresses, and years tends to crack most wifi passwords in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>An approach which begins with quick, but often fruitful, attacks to more and more complex (and time consuming) attacks is the most rewarding. However, after an hour or two of password hacking, the in-office time on other activities is more valuable, so admit defeat and move on. See the Recommendations section for talking points around the levels of password cracking that exist in the world. You can work on passwords offline/overnight/post-audit for report completeness.</p>
<p>Here is a suggested path to take with suggested tools to help. You might try the first few steps in both the targeted keyword approach and the dictionary approach before moving on to the more complex mutations towards the end of each path.</p>
<ul>
<li>Targeted Keywords</li>
<li>Begin with a simple combination of organizationally relevant keywords (using hashcat's combinator attack, combining your org keyword list with itself)</li>
<li>Add in numbers/years (simple scripting, hashcat, JtR)</li>
<li>Add in other mutators like 1337 replacements, capitalization tricks (John)</li>
<li>Language dictionary attack (simple scripting, hashcat)</li>
<li>Run a series of dictionary word attacks:
<ul>
<li>A simple language dictionary attack</li>
<li>Add in numbers/years (simple scripting, hashcat, JtR)</li>
<li>Add in the org keywords (a full combination creates a massive list, recommend starting with 1:1)</li>
<li>Try other combinations of the dictionary, keywords, years</li>
<li>Add in other mutators like 1337 replacements, capitalization tricks (John)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brute forcing (do not bother with this on-site)</li>
<li>John's incremental modes, limited by types</li>
<li>Crunch's raw brute-force attack (very, very time intensive - a complete waste of time without GPUs)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dictionary Research and Creation</h4>
<p><strong>Before you arrive on-site</strong> it is important to have your password cracking tools downloaded and relevant dictionaries ready to go, as your main demonstration and use of these tools is to gain access to the organization's network. The effectiveness of this demonstration is drastically reduced if you already have had to ask for the password to connect to the Internet and update your dictionaries, tools, or so on. Some of these files (especially larger password dictionaries) can be quite large, so downloading them in-country is not recommended.</p>
<p>Many password dictionary sites, such as <a href="https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords">SkullSecurity</a> , maintain core dictionaries in multiple languages. If your target language is not available, some quick regular expression work can turn spell-check dictionaries (such as those used by <a href="http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center?getCategories=Dictionary">LibreOffice</a> into useful word lists. It is generally useful to always test with English in addition to the target language.</p>
<p>[CloudCracker(]https://www.cloudcracker.com/dictionaries.html) and <a href="http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/">OpenWall</a> have, for a fee, well-tested password dictionaries.</p>
<h3>Keyword generation</h3>
<p>In addition, create a customized dictionary with words related to the subject as revealed in the Remote Assessment research: organization name, street address, phone number, email domain, wireless network name, etc. For the organization &quot;ExampleOrg , which has its offices at 123 Central St., Federal District, Countryzstan , which does human rights and journalism work and was founded in 1992, some context-based dictionary additions would be:</p>
<pre><code>exampleorg
example
exa
mple
org
123
central
federal
district
countryzstan
human
rights
journo
journalism
1992
92</code></pre>
<p>Also add common password fragments: qwerty, 1234/5/6/7/8, and, based on field experience, four-digit dates back to the year 2001 (plus adding in the founding year of the organization). It's quite amazing how often a recent year will be part of a wifi password -- this presentation discusses many common patterns in passwords: https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf</p>
<h5>Optional Further steps</h5>
<p>Use <a href="http://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php">CeWL</a>, to spider the organization's web properties to generate additional phrases. This list will need review, as some of the generated content is not very useful, but may be useful if the site is not in a language the auditor reads fluently.</p>
<p>For passwords other than WPA, specific policies or patterns may help to focus your password dictionary further. <a href="https://github.com/iphelix/PACK">PACK, or Password Analysis and Cracking Toolkit</a> is a collection of utilities developed to aid in analysis of password lists in order to enhance password cracking through pattern detection of masks, rules, character-sets and other password characteristics. The toolkit generates valid input files for Hashcat family of password crackers.&quot; PACK is most useful for large sets of passwords, where it can detect patterns in already-broken passwords to help build new rules. Both password cracking tools listed here are powerful, and have slightly different abilities. The auditor should choose the one they prefer and/or the one which has the features they desire for this job.</p>
<h4>Combinator Attack with scripting and Hashcat</h4>
<p>One quick way to build a more complex password list is to simply double the list up (a &quot;combinator&quot; attack), so that it includes an entry for each pair of these strings:</p>
<p>You can do a 1-way version of this list simply, such as:</p>
<pre><code> $ for foo in `cat pwdlist.txt`; do for bar in `cat pwdlist.txt`; do printf $foo$bar&#39;\n&#39;; done; done &gt; pwdpairs.txt
 $ cat pwdlist.txt &gt;&gt; pwdpairs.txt</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/">Hashcat</a> can do this in a live attack under its &quot;combinator&quot; mode, and hashcat-utils (hiding in /usr/share/hashcat-utils/combinator.bin) provides this as a standalone tool. This provides a true combination of the list, so it exponentially increases the list size - use with caution, or use with one larger dictionary and one smaller dictionary.</p>
<p>For example, use these combination approach on your custom dictionary (combining it with itself, creating combinations from the above list such as example92, journorights, exampleorgrights).</p>
<pre><code>$  /usr/share/hashcat-utils/combinator.bin dict.txt dict.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Hashcat is extremely powerful when you have desktop computer systems to use, but has a few wordlist manipulation tools that are useful regardless.</p>

<h4>Word mutation with John the Ripper (JtR)</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/commits/bleeding-jumbo">JtR</a> is a powerful tool you can use in combination of existing wordlists, but it also can add in common substitutions (people using zero for the letter &quot;o&quot;). JtR can be used to generate a static list of passwords for other programs, or it can be used directly against a password database. JtR is a bit weak combining words within a wordlist, so you should apply your customizations and any folding before moving on to JtR.</p>
<p>You can add custom &quot;rules&quot; to aid in these substitutions - a base set is included with JtR, but a much more powerful set is added by [KoreLogic] (http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html). KoreLogic also provides a custom character set &quot;chr file&quot; that takes password frequency data from large collections of <a href="http://www.korelogic.com/tools.html">real-world passwords to speed up JtR's brute force mode</a> . This PDF presentation has a good <a href="https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf">walkthrough of how John and Kore's rules work</a></p>
<p>Additional guides: * (http://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux)</p>
<p>The bleeding-edge jumbo version combines both the built-in rules and an optimized version of the <a href="https://github.com/kost/jtr-stuff/tree/master/rules,%20and%20http://openwall.info/wiki/john/rules%20for%20a%20description%20of%20the%20optimizations">KoreLogic rules</a>. <a href="http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html">This list of KoreLogic Rules</a> provides nice descriptions of what the KoreLogic rules do. In bleeding-jumbo, you can remove &quot;KoreLogicRules&quot;. <a href="http://backreference.org/2009/10/26/password-recovery-with-john-the-ripper/">BackReference</a> provides a great example of rules usage.</p>
<p>Some particularly useful ones individual rulesets are: * AppendYears (appends years, from 1900 to 2019) and AppendCurrentYearSpecial (appends 2000-2019 with punctuation) * AddJustNumbers (adds 1-4 digits to the end of everything) * l33t (leet-speek combinations)</p>
<p>There are some build-in combinations of rulesets - for example, just --rules runs john's internal collection of default rules, and --rules:KoreLogic runs a collection of the KoreLogic rules in a thoughtful order, and --rules:all is useful if you hate life.</p>
<p>e.g. :</p>
<pre><code>  $ john -w:dictionary.txt --rules:AppendYears --stdout</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/RULES.shtml">Building custom rules</a></p>
<p><strong>PROTIP</strong> Create a dictionary with just &quot;blah&quot; and run various rules against it to understand how each ruleset or combination works. Note specifically that each rule multiplies the size of the dictionary by the number of permutations it introduces. Running the KoreLogic ruleset combination against a <strong>one word</strong> dictionary creates a list of 6,327,540 permutations on just that word.</p>
<h4>Brute force, using John and crunch</h4>
<p>JtR's &quot;incremental&quot; mode is essentially an optimized brute force attack, so will take a very long time for anything but the shortest passwords, or passwords where you can limit the search space to a character set: &quot;As of version 1.8.0, pre-defined incremental modes are &quot;ASCII&quot; (all 95 printable ASCII characters), &quot;LM_ASCII&quot; (for use on LM hashes), &quot;Alnum&quot; (all 62 alphanumeric characters), &quot;Alpha&quot; (all 52 letters), &quot;LowerNum&quot; (lowercase letters plus digits, for 36 total), &quot;UpperNum&quot; (uppercase letters plus digits, for 36 total), &quot;LowerSpace&quot; (lowercase letters plus space, for 27 total), &quot;Lower&quot; (lowercase letters), &quot;Upper&quot; (uppercase letters), and &quot;Digits&quot; (digits only). The supplied .chr files include data for lengths up to 13 for all of these modes except for &quot;LM_ASCII&quot; (where password portions input to the LM hash halves are assumed to be truncated at length 7) and &quot;Digits&quot; (where the supplied .chr file and pre-defined incremental mode work for lengths up to 20). Some of the many .chr files needed by these pre-defined incremental modes might not be bundled with every version of John the Ripper, being available as a separate download.&quot; (http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/MODES.shtml)</p>
<p>As a last resort, you can try a direct brute force attack overnight or post-audit to fill in details on key strength. Crunch is a very simple but thorough approach. Given enough time it will break a password, but it's not particularly fast, even at simple passwords. You can reduce the scope of this attack (and speed it up) if you have a reason to believe the password is all lower-case, all-numeric, or so on. WPA passwords are a minimum of 8 characters, a maximum of 16, and some wifi routers will accept punctuation, but in practice these are usually just !@#$. — so:</p>
<pre><code>$ /path/to/crunch 8 16 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890$!@#$. | aircrack-ng -a 2 path/to/capture.pcap -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w -</code></pre>
<p>This says to try every possible alpha-numeric combination from 8 to 16 characters. This will take a very, very, very long time.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p>Any important password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent both standard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters of powerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character combination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a passphrase that contains five or more relatively uncommon words.) The key should not contain common “phrases,” expecially from well known literature like Shakespeare or religious texts, but also should not include number sequences or phrases, especially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work.</p>
<p>Specifically for wireless passwords, choosing a strong WPA key is one of the most ild not mportant steps toward defending an organization’s network perimeter from an adversary with the ability to spend some time in the vicinity of the offices. By extension, mitigating this vulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and confidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings down even the most well-secured information systems.</p>
<p>Because shared keys inevitably end up being written on whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the WPA key should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen frequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.</p>

<p>Note that password cracking systems are rated on the number of password guesses they make per second. Stock laptop computers without high-end graphics cards or any other optimizations can guess 2500 passwords/second. More powerful desktop computers can test over a hundred million each second, and with graphics cards (GPUs) that rises to billions of passwords per second. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking).</p>
<p>This website has a good explanation about how improving the complexity of a password affects how easy it is to break: http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi , but is using very out of date numbers - consider a basic laptop able to produce &quot;Class E&quot; attacks, and a desktop, &quot;Class F&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Vulnerability Analysis --></p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-scanning-and-analysis">Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="summary-34">Summary</h3>
<p>This component has the auditor discover possible flaws the organization's devices, services, application designs, and networks by testing and comparing them against a variety of online and offline resources (vulnerability databases, vendor advisories, and auditor investigation) to identify known vulnerabilities. Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network, however, deeper research into specific discovered exploits can happen after the on-site audit to fully take advantage of the short time the auditor has on site.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-10">Purpose</h3>
<p>It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to outsource most of its IT infrastructure to a cloud provider, such as Google Apps, or to ad-hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, etc.). A better-resourced organization may be more likely to host its critical services at a remote data center, but not have someone designated to update and patch systems as vulnerabilities are released, or to view the services from a security -- as opposed to availability -- standpoint.</p>

<h4>Vulnerability Scanning</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>While much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around the office, remote attacks on the organization's website, extranets, and unintended information available from &quot;open sources&quot; all pose real threats and deserve significant attention. SAFETAG takes great care to take a very passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine operational security concerns.</p>
<p>This activity uses active research and scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in external and key internal services. Usually penetration tests exploit possible vulnerabilities to confirm their existence. <a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> But, the use of exploits puts the organization's systems at a level of increased risk <a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> that is unacceptable when neither the organization nor the auditor has the time or finances to address the issue. The SAFETAG methodology only uses relatively safe exploitation of vulnerabilities for targeted outcomes. For instance, cracking the wireless access point password allows us to demonstrate the importance of good passwords without singling out any individual's passwords. <a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Identify services being hosted or used by an organization</li>
<li>Research externally-facing organization services (websites, services hosted from the office, etc.)</li>
<li>Research information about identified services (e.g current versions of those services.)</li>
<li>Run vulnerability scans against websites hosted by the organization, externally facing servers run by the organization, and key intranet servers.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>A Kali VM, bootable USB, or installed system with OWASP ZAP or OpenVAS installed, updated, and running<br /></li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Be very careful about which automated scans you run to ensure that no aggressive or potentially damaging tests are included.</li>
<li>OpenVAS saves its scan records in /var/lib/openvas/mgr/tasks.db - this file will contain sensitive data, ensure it is stored securely.</li>
<li>OpenVAS and other vulnerability scanners can be highly aggressive in their tactics. Tools like Metasploit come with a library of active, functional exploits to &quot;prove&quot; that a system is actively vulnerable. As such, these can be tricky to use. Even OpenVAS on a safe-only scan can appear to a host as an active attack, blocking further access from your IP (this can cause some annoyance if you are, for example, scanning your host organization's website from their network). Some of these scans and techniques -- again, even the &quot;safe&quot; ones -- can also be a violation of local hacking laws. Get explicit permission, give warnings, and be careful.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<h5>Setting up OpenVAS in Kali</h5>
<pre><code>openvas initial setup
openvas feed update
openvas check setup
openvas stop
openvas start</code></pre>
<p>Visit <a href="https://127.0.0.1:9392/">https://127.0.0.1:9392/</a> in a web browser and log in.</p>
<h5>Using OpenVAS</h5>
<p>Once logged in to OpenVAS, the interface is disturbingly simple to use. For most use, using the Wizard to scan the target server works best. Things to verify before doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the Scan defaults for the Wizard - it should be set to run the built-in &quot;Full and Fast&quot; scan</li>
<li>For that scan, verify (under Configuration-&gt;Scan Configs) that the &quot;Scan Settings&quot; list shows &quot;safe_checks&quot; as &quot;yes&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start a scan, change the display to &quot;auto refresh&quot; to give you more feedback on the scan process. Once the scan is completed, a report can be exported in PDF form.</p>
<h5>Common problems</h5>
<p><strong>Errors during openvas-start</strong></p>
<p>OpenVAS is a rather ... delicate program. Most often, the openvas-start script will not wait long enough between launching openvassd and openvasmd, causing openvasmd to error out. Re-running openvasmd often works, though an entire stop/start cycle seems to be slightly more reliable. Often, openvasmd will error out, but launch anyway. Checking the web interface at https://127.0.0.1:9392 to make sure that you can log in is the best way to check if it's actually successfully launched.</p>
<p><strong>Lost admin password</strong> From a root command-line, you can reset the web interface's admin password:</p>
<pre><code>openvasmd --create-user=admin 
openvasmd --user=admin --new-password=admin</code></pre>
<p><strong>openvasmd will never launch</strong> <em>The below applies to OpenVAS 7</em></p>
<p>In many fresh install cases, the openVAS self-signed CA certificate is set to an invalid date, which also causes openvasmd to error out. The check-setup script will recommend rebuilding the database, but the /var/log/openvas/openvasmd.log may have errors discussing certificate errors. If this is the case, try:</p>
<pre><code>rm /var/lib/openvas/CA/*
rm /var/lib/openvas/private/CA/*
openvas-mkcert
openvas-mkcert-client -n -i
openvas-check-setup 
openvas-start
openvasmd --rebuild
openvas-stop
openvas-start</code></pre>
<!-- DEPRECATED: !INCLUDE "owasp-zap.md" -->
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>The auditor will need to do research and compare against the organization's capacity and risks to give specific recommendations based on the vulnerabilities discovered in the process. Some common recommendations include the following:</p>
<h5>Out of Date Content Manangement System</h5>
<p>Most popular CMS platforms provide emailed alerts and semi-automated ways to update their software. Make sure someone responsible for the website is either receiving these emails or checking regularly for available updates. Security updates should be applied immediately. It is a best practice however to have a “test” site where you can first deploy any CMS update before attempting it on a production site.</p>
<p>For custom CMS systems, it is strongly advisable to migrate to a more standard, open source system.</p>
<h5>Insecure Website Login</h5>
<p>HTTPS / SSL – this comes at a cost, both the SSL Certificate and often an upgrade to the hosting plan itself. However, without SSL, every password – including the one used for admin access to the website – goes across the Internet in the clear. This is immediately available to a state-level actor through the ISP, and can also be sniffed if accessed by a staff member on a shared wifi connection (at a coffeeshop or airport), and finally if the attacker has broken in to the office network (see the Local Access section). Enabling SSL (and making it the default for your site) also protects the users of your site.</p>
<p>If an organization updates their website via FTP, it is worth noting that FTP is similarly insecure. Many hosting providers provide SFTP or FTPS, (two different, but secure, FTP versions), or secure WebDAV to upload files. These should be used, turning “plain” FTP off altogether if possible.</p>
<p>When switching to SSL/Secure FTP after having used the plain versions, webmasters should also update all administrative passwords, and watch to make sure that no step along the way (hosting provider management/panel, file upload, CMS editing) goes over “clear” channels.</p>
</div>
<div class="boxtext">
<h4>Check for common website vulnerabilities</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Content management systems require ongoing maintenance and updates to stay secure. Quite often these (or specific plugins) fall out of date and become increasingly vulnerable to automated as well as targeted attacks.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Determine the version of any content management system used by the organization</li>
<li>Search for potential security vulnerabilities for that version.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>The publicly-accessible CHANGELOG file at http://www.sampleorg.org/CHANGELOG.txt reveals an out of date, and security-compromised (https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2012-004), version of Drupal. Upgrade immediately.</p>
<pre><code>Drupal 6.27, 2012-12-19
----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities), see SA-CORE-2012-004.
Drupal 6.26, 2012-05-02
----------------------
- Fixed a small number of bugs.
- Made code documentation improvements.</code></pre>
<p>For Drupal, try visiting /CHANGELOG.txt , which, if not manually removed, will reveal the most recent version of Drupal installed on the server. Other telltale signs depend on the specific Drupal release; http://corporate.adulmec.ro/blog/2010/drupal-detection-test-site-running-drupal maintains a detection tool.</p>
<p>For Joomla, default templates provide strong hints towards versions based on copyright dates. Specific versions can often be discovered using this guide: https://www.gavick.com/magazine/how-to-check-the-version-of-joomla.html</p>
<p>Wordpress sites tend to advertise their version number in the header of each webpage, such as</p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;generator&quot; content=&quot;WordPress 3.3.1&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There is a web-based tool with browser add-ons available here: http://www.whitefirdesign.com/tools/wordpress-version-check.html</p>
<p>For other CMS systems, try BuiltWith (http://builtwith.com)</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>Most popular CMS platforms provide emailed alerts and semi-automated ways to update their software. Make sure someone responsible for the website is either receiving these emails or checking regularly for available updates. Security updates should be applied immediately. It is a best practice however to have a “test” site where you can first deploy any CMS update before attempting it on a production site.</p>
For custom CMS systems, it is strongly advisable to migrate to a more standard, open source system.

<h3>Explore Vulnerability Databases</h3>
<h4>Vulnerability Research</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Explore Vulnerability Databases (OVAL, CVE, vendor advisories) for potential risks of systems and software used on servers, user devices, and online services (including the organization's website/CMS)</li>
<li>Search Exploit Databases to find examples of exploitation of possible vulnerabilities identified.</li>
<li>Explore default configurations for vulnerabilities such as default passwords or users.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.</li>
<li>Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Penetrating Wireless Routers</h3>
<h4>Router Based Attacks</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Many wireless routers still use the default password listed in <a href="http://www.routerpasswords.com/">“Router Default Password Search”</a>, meaning that anyone with access to the network could also take complete control of the router - adding in remote access tools or setting up other attacks.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Find the router(s) (<code>route</code> works well for this)</li>
<li>Test using default passwords</li>
<li>Check for upgrades / un-patched vulnerabilities and backdoors</li>
<li>Investigate potentially valuable data (logs, connected users)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<h5>Material that may be Useful:</h5>
<ul>
<li><em>Search Engine:</em> <a href="http://www.routerpasswords.com/">“Router Default Password Search”</a> (RouterPasswords.com)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p><strong>Change Default Router Passwords</strong></p>
<p>Passwords - particularly on core network devices - is very important. Use a password manager to save the new password (or be prepared to reset the router to a factory default).</p>
<p>While nominally &quot;inside the firewall&quot; and protected from remote attacks, leaving routers with default passwords, particularly wireless routers whose networks are often shared with visitors, is a potentially very high risk for an organization. Anyone who has gained access to the network via legitimate or other means could subtly alter the router's configuration to provide remote access, or route traffic to an attacker-designated server. Such changes can easily go undetected for long periods of time.</p>
A common fear is forgetting the new router password. A password management system is an obvious solution, but if the router is in a secure location, even a stickie note would be better than the default password.

<p><!-- Data Assessment (assets) --></p>
<h2 id="data-assessment">Data Assessment</h2>
<h3 id="summary-40">Summary</h3>
<p>This component allows the auditor to identify what sensitive data exists for the organization, where it is stored, and how it is transferred.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-11">Purpose</h3>
<p>Sensitive files are often stored across multiple devices with different levels of security. A data assessment allows the auditor to recommend secure storage solutions which best meet the organizations risk assessment and workflow needs. While the auditor has insight on some of this based on the Network Access and Network Mapping work, cross-staff understanding and agreement on what constitutes sensitive data will support later organizational change.</p>
<p>An adversary who obtains a laptop, workstation, or backup drive will be able to read or modify sensitive information on the device, even if that staff member has set a strong account password. This applies to threats involving loss, theft, and confiscation, but also to &quot;checkpoint&quot; scenarios in which they may only have access for a few minutes. Furthermore, in the event of a burglary or office raid, an adversary could obtain all sensitive information on the organization's devices, possibly even undetected.</p>

<h4>Sensitive Data</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Data and meta-data about an organization and its staff is incredibly difficult to keep track of over time, as people or projects use cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive for some activities, a shared server for others, and a mix of work and personal devices (laptops, phones, tablets...).</p>
<p>This is natural, but it is important to keep track of where your organization's data lives and who can access it.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>With staff input, post up popular places where data is kept (laptops, email, shared drives...)</li>
<li>Using stickies, gather from the staff what data is kept in what locations - duplicating notes when needed</li>
<li>Rank data by sensitivity</li>
<li>Discuss the impact of one of the devices where data is stored being lost - are there backups?</li>
<li>Discuss the impact of a device being exposed / taken by an adversary</li>
<li>Identify who has access (physical access, login access, and permissions), and who needs to have access to get the organizations work completed.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>Stickies and markers for activities</li>
<li>Flip chart paper or a whiteboard</li>
<li>Camera to record outputs digitally</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Some of the stickies generated in this activity may provide sensitive data, dispose of them responsibly.</li>
<li>If you take photos for reporting needs, save the image files in a secure, encrypted container.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p><strong>Sensitive Data Assessment Activity</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Duration: 45 minutes</em> </strong></p>
<p><em>This exercise is adapted from the LevelUp Activity, <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/activity/backup-matrix">Backup Matrix</a>, part of the curricula for <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/data-retention-and-backup">Data Retrention and Backup</a> by Daniel O'Clunaigh, Ali Ravi, Samir Nassar, and Carol.</em></p>
<h5>Materials to Prepare:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Stickies</li>
<li>Markers</li>
<li>Flipchart paper</li>
<li>One larger sheet of paper taped to wall in landscape orientation, with or without prepared titles. (For an example with prepared headings, see the matrix below.) The Sensitivity axis is optional in the original exercise, but critical for this one. It can be added after the initial round of brainstorming however to streamline the flow.</li>

</table>
<p>Explain to participants that we're going to conduct an information mapping activity to get a sense of where our important information actually is.</p>
<p>Start by listing the different places where our information is stored, according to participants. If no suggestions are forthcoming, we can prompt participants with the obvious stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer hard drives</li>
<li>USB flash drives</li>
<li>External hard drives</li>
<li>Cellphones</li>
<li>CDs &amp; DVDs (and BDs)</li>
<li>Our email inbox</li>
<li>The Cloud: Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, etc</li>
<li>Physical copies (or “hard copies”) in the office</li>
<li>Multimedia: Video tapes, audio recordings, photographs, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use large stickies to place these as column headers on a wall. More will come up later in the course of the exercise.</p>
<p>Elicit from participants what type of information or data they have in each of these places. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Contact details, such as a member database</li>
<li>Reports/research</li>
<li>Funder information / contracts</li>
<li>Accounts/spreadsheets</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Private messages on Facebook, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To encourage participant interaction, write one example on a sticky and place it in the appropriate box in the matrix. Then, ask whether there is another copy of this data somewhere. If there is, you can use another sticky and put it wherever they keep the duplicate.</p>
<p><em>TIP:</em> Place Computers, Phones, and Email next to each other, so you won't have to create duplicates for everything &quot;stored&quot; in email (and therefore on laptops and phones)</p>
<p>Introduce a new vertical axis representing sensitivity. The higher on the chart, the more sensitive the data. Ask the participants to rank data.</p>
<p>For a large group, divide the group into smaller teams for the next steps (it helps if there are relatively clear thematic distinctions within the group, such as nationality, type of work, area of interest, etc.)</p>
<p>Provide stickies to the group(s). Have the group(s) brainstorm about all of the data they work with, focusing on the most important data first.</p>
<p>Participants should write ONE type per sticky, and create duplicates if the data is stored in multiple locations.</p>
<p>For a small group, this can be done as a &quot;live&quot; brainstorm. For larger groups that have been subdivided, have each group finish listing out their most important data and then have each group place the stickies on the matrix. Invite discussions around the sensitivity of the data.</p>
<p>An example may look something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/backup-matrix-example.png" alt="Level Up Backup Matrix Example" /><figcaption>Level Up Backup Matrix Example</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Explain that this gives us an idea of where our data is. Elicit whether or not this is all the data we generate? Of course it isn't: It's only a small percentage.</p>
<p>The LevelUp lesson uses this primarily to discuss the importance of backups, and this is a valuable point to make.</p>
<p>Call out the information that they are keeping on their computer's hard drive (which will usually be the fullest one). Elicit some of the things that can cause a computer to stop working. Maybe take a show of hands: Who has had this happen to them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Virus or malware attack destroyed a computer or some data</li>
<li>Stolen computer, confiscated computer</li>
<li>Infrastructural problems, like a power failure broke a computer</li>
<li>Inexplicably bricked computer, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For SAFETAG, we focus on the &quot;Sensitive data in the wrong hands&quot; section. Based on the clustering of sensitive data along the vertical access, choose a column that has an unsual amount of sensitive data (email or computers, usually).</p>
<p>Remove the stickies from the column but keep them in your hand and read them. Now I have this information. What can I do with it? And what are you left with? Is anyone at risk - yourselves? partners? If this were published on the Internet, what would happen?</p>

<h5>Overview</h5>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p><strong>Personal Information To Keep Private</strong></p>
<p>Information that can be used to identify individuals, organizations, and even communities of practice should be treated with the utmost care. Some data, like names, phone numbers, and addresses are obvious, while others, like computer names, the MAC addresses of wifi cards, or pseudonymous social media accounts may be less obvious. Also, combinations of information - location, data, and type of activity, or even an issue area of interest and a city name may specify a very small number of activists or organizations.</p>
<p>This spreadsheet, part of the <a href="https://wiki.responsibledata.io/RDF_Budapest">Responsible Data Forum documentation sprint</a> provides a useful baseline of types of data and ways to manage or obfsucate it usefully: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qf90P7dlXL6bwfG9vDpapQe1HUD1PtCqjJwayn0xOkQ/edit?usp=sharing">Data Anonymization Checklist</a></p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>For the internal audit report back to the organization, much of the information will require specific identification of user devices (and by extension, their users), as well as very sensitive organizational data. None of this data, by intention, accident, or adversarial action, should be shared with third parties.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Analysis and Reporting section for the limited data set that is required for project reporting, and to the Operational Security section for guidance on data security.</p>

<p><!-- Physical Assessment --></p>
<h2 id="physical-assessment">Physical Assessment</h2>
<h3 id="summary-44">Summary</h3>
<p>During this component an auditor flags potential risks related to physical access, storage, backups, and encryption of digital assets and suggests new policies and practices. It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of physical security. This guide does not provide a full physical security assessment.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-12">Purpose</h3>
<p>While the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, the physicality of devices, backup drives, servers, and even hard-wired networks cannot be overlooked. For many organizations, digital threats that depend on physical access are considered the least probable. So much so, that many security specialists concede that there is no proper defense against an attacker with physical access to sensitive hardware. While there is some truth to this, it is not useful advice for small scale civil society organizations or independent media houses. The risks that advocacy and media organizations face are far more varied, and the cost of lost information can be crippling to their ability to operate. As such, these risks have high severity, despite their equally high probability for these organizations.</p>

<h4>Guided Tour</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>The physical assessment methodology is focused on how to mitigate against threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the physical world.</p>
<p>The assessment uses a walkthrough and interview methodology to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are daily devices used and stored?</li>
<li>Where are they when employees go home?</li>
<li>Are there active network jacks that are unused, are they in public spaces, are they in places where people would not notice if there was somthing plugged into them?</li>
<li>How are backups managed? Where are they stored?</li>
<li>Where are the servers and network components that host and manage the organizations assets?</li>
<li>Who has independent access to the office space?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Have your point of contact walk you around the office (often as part of introductions on the first day) - mentally note physical security concerns.</li>
<li>Discuss access policies</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>A notepad may be useful</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p><strong>Step 1 : Guided Tour</strong></p>
<p>As part of your first day, have your point of contact walk you around the office - this is primarily a chance to understand the office layout and meet the rest of the staff, but take mental note of the devices in use and laying out on desks as you walk around the office. Note as well the location and access to components such as servers and networking components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Device usage and storage,</li>
<li>Sensitive information or external storage drives lying on desks,</li>
<li>Accounts/passwords written on post-its, white-boards, etc.,</li>
<li>Unattended, logged in computers,</li>
<li>Unlocked cabinets, computer rooms, or wiring closets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking actual notes may make the staff feel that you are judging them, so refrain from this if possible, especially if this is your first interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 : Access Policies</strong></p>
<p>Working with your POC and other relevant staff (administrative/operational staff, IT staff), enumerate list of everyone who has independent access to the office space, and routine after-hours access (i.e. who is able to unlock the space). This may include cleaning or other service personnel. Shared office spaces present unique challenges, and access policies and procedures for the building housing the office may also become relevant.</p>
<!-- 
**Step 3 : (Optional) After Ours Walk-Through**

Also schedule a time with your primary point of contact to visit the office when all (or at least most) staff are not present.  This could be before the staff arrives in the morning, or after hours (perhaps have dinner with your POC, and come back to check the organization afterwards). Other significantly less ideal options could be during a lunch break or a meeting when the staff are offsite or in a conference room.

During this time, go back through the office (taking notes for the audit this time) to see how devices are outside of the work day (are desktops and laptops unsecured, still on, logged in?).  Are backup drives or other storage media easily accessible? Are doors to server rooms/closets locked?  Are keys to these locked cabinets/rooms visible?

Also note and test network ports that are not in use, looking especially for ones which are not in plain sight.
-->

<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p><strong>Office Equipment is unsecured against burglary</strong></p>
<p>Unsecured physical network components and devices such as computers, servers, and external drives present a risk of sensitive data loss through theft, seizure, and malicious interference. Access to network compontents and servers should be limited and devices should be secured when not in use.</p>
<p>In the event of a burglary or office raid, an attacker could easily obtain sensitive information from devices without encryption, external hard drives, and other easily accessible items. An advanced attacker could compromise the network for later surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Devices</strong></p>
<p><em>Lock in desks or via security cables all easily portable items</em></p>
<p>Any device which connects to the organization's digital assets (and therefore has passwords or cached data) or stores organizational data (including backup drives, laptops, desktops, cameras, other storage media), should be secured (ideally out of sight, such as in a locked cabinet or desk drawer) when not in use to prevent theft and discourage seizure.</p>
<p><em>Follow the Device Assessment guidelines on drive encryption.</em></p>
<p>Encrypted drives offer the best protection against data loss from stolen or seized devices. Follow the recommendations of the Device Assessment section, paying specific attention to the need for strong passwords, automatic locking of logged-in accounts, and the importance of turning a machine off to fully benefit from drive encryption.</p>
<p><em>Place core network components and servers in a locked space.</em></p>
<p>Direct access to servers and network components such as routers, cablemodems, patch panels and switches provides an adversary multiple ways to extract sensitive information and cause extensive, yet hard to detect, damage. Ensuring that not only are these physically protected, but that there are organizational policies around which staff have access to them is critical - a locked cabinet that always has the key in the lock does not provide security. If a particular component needs, for example, regular rebooting, creative solutions should be found to balance security and staff needs.</p>
<p><em>De-activate unused network ports</em></p>
<p>Hard-wired network ports tend to connect directly into the most trusted parts of a network. De-activating any that are in public areas of the office (front desk, conference rooms, break rooms), as well as any that are not needed is recommended.</p>

<h2 id="process-mapping-and-risk-modeling">Process Mapping and Risk Modeling</h2>
<h3 id="summary-48">Summary</h3>
<p>This component allows an auditor to lead the host organization's staff in a series of activities to identify and prioritize the processes that are critical for the organization to carry out its work. These activities will also reveal the consequences if those critical processes were interrupted or exposed to a malicious actor. This results in the staff creating a risk matrix which is used as the foundation of the auditor's recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-13">Purpose</h3>
<p>Having the host organization central to the risk assessment process allows the auditor to put their threats and recommendations into the host's own narrative. With greater ownership of the process the staff will be more engaged in addressing the threats identified when the audit is complete. <a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> By engaging as many staff as possible the auditor also is providing a framework for staff to examine future concerns when the auditor is gone. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.</p>

<h4>Process Mapping</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This activity helps to identify the processes that allow the organization to function (publishing, payment, fund-raising, outreach, interviewing) the assets and systems (websites, software, PayPal) they rely on, and which ones are critical to their work. (Activity)</p>
<p>Participants are asked to &quot;brain-storm&quot; a list of all the processes that are critical for their work and the auditor works to map the details of critical processes out to expose points of risk.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Brainstorm with staff all of the organizational processes</li>
<li>Identify a smaller set which are mission critical</li>
<li>Map the specific interactions and events that compose these processes to expose areas of risk</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>Stickies</li>
<li>Markers</li>
<li>Whiteboard or flip-chart</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Treat device assessment data as well as any additional service information learned with the utmost security</li>
<li>Ensure that any physical notes/drawings are erased and destroyed once digitally recorded.</li>
<li>Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure and encrypted.</li>
<li>Consider who has physical and visual access to the room where this process takes place, and if the room can be secured if this activity may span long/overnight breaks.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>The goal of this exercise is for the auditor to lead the host participants in &quot;brain-storming&quot; and mapping all the processes that are critical for the organization to carry out their work.</p>
<h5>Additional Material</h5>
<ul>
<li>Chart Paper or whiteboard.</li>
<li>Marker pens or whiteboard markers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>The auditor gives the participants a few example processes for a small independent media outlet.</p>
<ul>
<li>News gathering</li>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Publishing</li>
<li>User Feedback</li>
<li>Lead Development</li>
<li>Paying Staff</li>
<li>Getting Advertisers</li>
<li>Collecting Payment from Advertisers</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the participants have brainstormed these out the facilitator leads the participants in identifying the critical processes (this may be all of the processes identified.)</p>
<ul>
<li>News gathering</li>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Publishing</li>
<li>Lead Development</li>
<li>Paying Staff</li>
</ul>
<p>The trainer then begins a free-hand process mapping activity for each process. You will be &quot;charting the sequence of events of the work.&quot;</p>
<p>A Process Map shows</p>
<ul>
<li>The people involved; * The tasks, conversations, and decisions they carry out;</li>
<li>The flow of materials, information and documents between them;</li>
<li>The relationship and dependance between the steps.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conducting the Activity</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>List all organizational processes:</strong> The goal of this exercise is for the auditor to lead the host participants in &quot;brain-storming&quot; a list of all the processes the organization takes part in to carry out their work. It is important to remember this is a brainstorming session of all of the processes that occur in the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quickly identify the main purpose of the organization. If the organization is an online newspaper, the purpose then is to create, distribute, and diversify the content they are providing to their consumers.</p></li>
<li><p>Write out the list of all the processes that would occur in a very busy week at the office. This is a brainstorming session with your participants so it is important to get them to identify as many different processes at the beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a complete list has been created, the auditor will then go through through to identify with the participants the critical processes within the organization – that is, without these processes the organization would not be able to function or function at a very poor level</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Determine critical processes:</strong> During this exercise the aim is for the auditor to lead the attendees in narrowing down the subset of activities to those that are crucial to their work.</p>
<ul>
<li>step 1</li>
<li>step 2</li>
<li>step 3</li>
<li>step etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> If an auditor does not ensure that the uniquely identified subset of processes speaks to the full range of participants, their recommendations are more likely to be met with resistance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Map out critical processes:</strong> In this exercises the auditor does free-hand mapping for each process guided by the host participants. The auditor needs to make sure that they work to develop a broad understanding of the overall process. This is a time consuming activity, and managing their overall time to complete the entire needs assessment, and respect the time constraints of the staff, is critical.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly identify the process name on the whiteboard or flipchart</li>
<li>Identify the first and last steps from the participants and write them on the side of the paper to keep the participants on track.</li>
<li>Place the &quot;Starting&quot; place on the white paper.</li>
<li>Have your participants explain to you what the process is step-by-step, while making a note on the side where there will be follow on processes.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Don’t forget about follow-on processes</li>
<li>List who does each step along side each process</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Verbally walk the participants through the completed process so you ensure you didn’t miss anything</li>
<li>Take quick notes to remind yourself of any key points not clearly marked on the map before they move on to the next activity.</li>
<li>After completing all the key events take a photo of the whiteboard / store the chart-paper for later documentation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>While doing this it is important to consider level of detail you will be mapping out (this should be pre-determined or established so everyone is on the same page)</p>
<h5>How to make a process map</h5>
<p>This process map will be used to develop our asset map.</p>
<p>&quot;Draw the flowchart initially to represent the operation, as it actually happens - NOT what you might prefer it to be! Use a flip chart or whiteboard to produce your initial charts&quot;</p>
<pre><code>&quot;WHO does WHAT (Job title/Function e.g. Level A1)
WHAT is done and WHEN
What DECISIONS have to be taken and
What possible paths follow from each decision&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Keep it simple to facilitate broad understanding of the OVERALL process. Too much detail early on can be overwhelming and/or lead to confusion. If you agree that more detail is required on a particular action, it is easy to highlight that box and produce a separate chart showing the process taking place within.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
This activity can lead to feelings of hopelessness; it is important to remind the staff that any risk can be mitigated, and indeed it is the goal of an audit to identify the highest priority ones based on actual likelihood and provide guidance on mitigation.

<h4>Risk Modeling Using the Pre-Mortum Strategy</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>The pre-mortum strategy was devised to take participants out of a perspective of defending their plans and strategies and shielding themselves from flaws. They are given &quot;a perspective where they [are] actively searching for flaws in their own plan.&quot; <a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a>.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Pre-Mortum&quot; Activity</li>
<li>Identification of critical processes</li>
<li>Selected critical process mapping</li>
<li>Threat Identification (Control/Confidentialy/Idenity/Integrity/Authentication/Access)</li>
<li>Impact Identification</li>
<li>Adversary Exploration (Likelyhood)</li>
<li>Impact Ranking</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>Stickies</li>
<li>Whiteboard or flip-chart</li>
<li>Markers</li>
<li>Camera to digitally capture the data</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Treat risk modeling data with the utmost security</li>
<li>Ensure that any physical notes/drawings are erased and destroyed once digitally recorded.</li>
<li>Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure and encrypted.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<h5>Additional Material</h5>
<ul>
<li>Chart Paper / whiteboard.</li>
<li>Marker pens / whiteboard markers.</li>
<li>Multiple colors of post-its.</li>
<li>Camera for documenting the process.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a flipchart / space on the white-board to keep track of process', threats, impacts, and adversaries that are identified during other activities. Participants can easily get ahead of the process as they explore individual ideas. Keeping a space for these &quot;upcoming&quot; activities will help re-center them on the activity at hand.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conducting the Activity</h4>
<p><strong>Pre-Mortum Strategy: (30 Minutes)</strong> The pre-mortum strategy was devised to take participants out of a perspective of defending their plans and strategies and shielding themselves from flaws. They are given &quot;a perspective where they [are] actively searching for flaws in their own plan.&quot; <a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the pre-mortum activity. The participants are to imagine that it is months into the future and they have continued doing their work as normal. And something happened that left them entirely unable to function or functioning at a very poor level. &quot;That is all they know; they have to explain what has happened.&quot; <a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></li>
<li>Create a broad list of possible explanations for what has happened.</li>
<li>Identify the most likely explanations.</li>
<li>List the process' that would have to fail for those causes to take effect.</li>
<li>Identify two to three process' that are central to the failures and write them on a list of <em>critical process'.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process/Interaction Mapping (30 minutes per process):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a process from the list of <em>critical processes</em> identified above.</li>
<li>Clearly identify the process name on the whiteboard or flipchart.</li>
<li>Create a list of individuals who take part in the process.</li>
<li>Draw a symbol of the person.</li>
<li>Write a label describing their role or title.</li>
<li>Draw lines with arrows connecting individuals who interact with each other in this process.</li>
<li>Label the lines with words describing the interaction.</li>
<li>Write numbers on the interactions to show the order they occur in.</li>
<li><p>Continue this activity with the next <em>critical process.</em></p></li>
<li><strong>NOTES:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can add follow-on processes to examine if they are identified as critical by the participants during this activity. Specifically, the exercises in the Threat Assessment section pair well.</li>
<li>Put people on post-its to make them moveable.</li>
<li>Verbally walk the participants through the completed process so you ensure you didn't miss anything.</li>
<li>Take quick notes to remind yourself of any key points not clearly marked on the map before they move on to the next activity.</li>
<li>After completing all the key events take a photo of the whiteboard / store the chart-paper for later documentation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
This activity can lead to feelings of hopelessness as well as stir up direct fears or challenges that the staff face. It is important to remind the staff that any risk can be mitigated, and indeed it is the goal of an audit to identify the highest priority ones based on actual likelihood and provide guidance on mitigation.

<!-- Threat Assessment -->

<h2 id="threat-assessment">Threat Assessment</h2>
<h3 id="summary-51">Summary</h3>
<p>This objective uses a variety of activities to identify possible attackers and gather background information about the capability of those attackers to threaten the organization. This consists of identifying a particular attacker's history of carrying out specific threats, their capability to carry out those threats currently, and proof that the threat has intent to leverage resources against the target.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-14">Purpose</h3>
<p>Checking the assumptions both of the organization and of the auditor by researching the current threats will ensure that an auditor is basing their work on accurate assessments of the conditions the organization faces and that they are making informed operational security considerations. With greater ownership of the process the staff provides an opportunity to explore their threat landscape and become more engaged in addressing the threats identified when the audit is complete. By engaging with as many staff as possible the auditor is providing a framework for staff to explore threat identification processes when the auditor is gone.</p>

<h4>Threat Identification</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>These activities build off of a process or data mapping exercise to connect actual processes or assets and data of the organization with potential threats, then drilling down into specific, likely threats the organization faces, adversaries who might take advantage of them, and the impact of this happening.</p>
<p>The goal is to be able to answer the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>Threat History</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What history of attacks does the threat actor have?</li>
<li>What techniques have they used? Have they targeted vulnerabilities that the organization currently has?</li>
<li>What is known about the types of threats used by an threat actor to attack similar organizations?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat Capability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does the threat actor have the means to exploit a vulnerability that the organization currently has?</li>
<li>Does the threat actor have the means to leverage widespread threats against all similar organizations, or will they have to prioritize their targets?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat Intent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have they targeted similar organizations?</li>
<li>Does the threat actor currently have the desire to conduct an attack against this type of organization?</li>
<li>Is the organization a priority threat target for the threat actor?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Identify and categorize threats to processes or data (requires a process or data mapping exercise) by Confidentiality, Control, Integrity, Identity, Availability, and Auditability</li>
<li>Identify the impact of each threat against People, Organization, and Program</li>
<li>Brainstorm potential Adversaries and note their History, Intent, and Capability per Threat</li>
<li>For Threats with identified Adversaries, rank them on a linear scale from &quot;Inconvenient&quot; to &quot;Severe&quot; (no two items can have the same rank)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>

</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<ul>
<li>Requires a process or data mapping exercise's outputs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threat Identification: (30 minutes per process)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give participants a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; of threats.</li>
<li>Explain the types of threats.
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: If unauthorized individuals find out an asset/process exists.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong>: If an asset/process can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: If an asset/process is changed without permission.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: If an asset/process becomes unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: If an asset/process becomes unreliable. (Some use <strong>Identity</strong> instead or in addition to Consistency, if an asset/process can be spoofed to appear as owning/coming from someone else.)</li>
<li><strong>Auditability</strong>: If you cannot verify that an asset/process is secure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identify a &quot;interaction line&quot; from the process map to start with.</li>
<li>Generate a list of threats that would cause that interaction to fail.</li>
<li>Mark the back of the post it with the interaction name or number.</li>
<li>Write the threat and their impact on post-its and arrange them in an orderly way.</li>
<li>If multiple risks cause the same consequence create a new post-it near the new risk.</li>
<li>Continue doing this for all the interactions in the critical process'.</li>
<li>Discuss and rearrange threats as groupings emerge.</li>
<li><p>Label threat clusters that appear.</p></li>
<li><strong>NOTES:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If any of the impacts identified in the pre-mortum or other process-mapping exercises are not covered ask participants where they would go.</li>
<li>Take photos of the threats once you have finished enumerating them.</li>
<li>Write risks on one set of post-its and impacts on another color of post-its to make it easy to keep track.</li>
<li>Look at the<a href="https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Cyber_Security_Assessments_of_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf#page=31">&quot;CVSS V2 Base Metrics&quot;</a> for an example of the severity of different threats.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact Identification: (30 minutes per process)</strong> This exercise has the trainee lead the participants on a brainstorming of hypothetical consequences (impacts) when the threats identified earlier occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give participants a pen and three sticky note pads.</li>
<li>Explain the topic and the categories. <a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>Staff/People - (which includes families, friends, and beneficiaries): temporary or permanent physical injury, temporary or longer-term psychological damage, death, legal costs, cost of medical treatment, loss of morale or trust in management.</li>
<li>Organization - loss of or damage to assets, operational inefficiency, loss of program quality or outright suspension; loss of reputation; loss of funding.</li>
<li>Program - reduced program quality, temporary suspension of the program, forced termination of the program.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instruct each person to generate DIRECT impacts based upon the exiting threat clustering from <strong>Threat Identification.</strong></li>
<li>Include only one impact per sticky note.</li>
<li>Have one participant quickly describe then place an impact on the board writing along side it the threat that causes it.</li>
<li>Invite others to place similar/the same impacts in proximity and quickly describe how it can occurs.</li>
<li>Repeat the process until all impacts are included.</li>
<li>Have participants add stickies for any secondary/cascading impacts</li>
<li>Discuss and rearrange impacts as groupings emerge.</li>
<li><p>Label impact clusters that appear.</p></li>
<li><strong>NOTES:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tell participants to write multiple impacts per color.</li>
<li>Look for opportunities to create sub-groups.</li>
<li>Limit the time frame for discussion.</li>
<li>Take photos of the impact clusters once you have finished enumerating them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adversary Exploration (Likelyhood):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the topic and the categories. <a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>&quot;History – a past incidence or pattern of attacks on similar organizations.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Intent – specific threats, a demonstrated intention or mindset to attack.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Capability – the wherewithal to carry out an attack.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brainstorm adversaries who have demonstrated likelihood to impact their work or one of the process'.</li>
<li>Pick an adversary and write their name on the board.</li>
<li>Write specific instances of adversary history, intent, and capacity announced by the participants.</li>
<li><p>Repeat the process until all adversaries are completed.</p></li>
<li><strong>NOTES:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Limit the time frame for discussion.</li>
<li>Take photos of the adversary lists.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact Ranking:</strong> The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the host organization in classifying the severity of the possible impacts from the threats they have just explored.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a post it for each impact.</li>
<li>Place two points on the wall. On one side are &quot;Inconvenient&quot; impacts that disrupt the organization in a very small way. On the other side are &quot;critical&quot; impacts that may pose life-safety risks to employees, partners, or the general public.</li>
<li>The low end of the scale may include a fire alarm may cause the staff to lose a half an hour of work time, but does not impact any short or long-term activities.</li>
<li>The high end of the scale would include events such as a fire that destroys the organizations headquarters and endangers staffs lives or legal issues that cause termination of the program.</li>
<li>Place each item along the severity line from least to most severe impact.</li>
<li><p>Give each item its own place on the scale. No two items can be the same severity.</p></li>
<li><strong>NOTES:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Listen carefully to every point of deliberation.</li>
<li>As risks are placed on the wall, the trainee can use other already ranked risks to help participants identify the right place. &quot;Is a robbery more or less likely than a fire?&quot;</li>
<li>Take photos of the impact scale once you have finished it.</li>

<h4>Threat Interaction</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>This helps the auditor enumerate threats that the organization is concerned about and the internal priorities of them. At the same time, it enables a discussion of how threats can interrelate and helps define the difference between a threat and a risk (a threat that has a vulnerability associated with it), and the value of mitigation.</p>
<p>This exercise works well with larger groups, and can be woven in to the Threat Identification activity.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Split participants into small groups and have them brainstorm on all possible threats, writing each on a separate stickie</li>
<li>Cluster the stickies to reveal duplicate concerns across the group and thematic areas</li>
<li>Mark the threats which have occurred</li>
<li>Select one threat and arrange other threats, where relevant, as potential causes or outcomes of that threat</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>Stickies (ideally 3 colors)</li>
<li>Pens/sharpies for participant groups</li>
<li>Markers</li>
<li>Camera to digitally capture the data</li>
<li>Whiteboard or flip-chart</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Treat threat and adversary data with the utmost security.</li>
<li>Ensure that any physical notes/drawings are erased and destroyed once digitally recorded.</li>
<li>Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure and encrypted.</li>
<li>Consider who has physical and visual access to the room where this process takes place, and if the room can be secured if this activity may span long/overnight breaks.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>Also review the Threat Identification exercises to tailor these to best meet your information gathering needs based on your interactions with the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Brainstorming (15 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>Split participants into small groups. This grouping is particularly valuable for larger organizations, but even for small ones, having multiple separate groups helps reveal shared concerns around the threats the staff face. For a group that is too small to group, have each staff member brainstorm by themselves.</p>
<p>Have each group or staff member quickly write down any possible &quot;threat&quot; they or the organization face. Some examples (&quot;kidnapping,&quot; &quot;website hacked&quot;) can help seed this activity.</p>
<p>If you have multiple colors of stickies, having them categorize threats by &quot;physical,&quot; &quot;digital,&quot; or &quot;other/both&quot; will be useful to show their inter-relation.</p>
<p>Keep reminding participants of the time remaining to keep them brainstorming rather than discussing threat details or arguing over whether a threat is physical or digital.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Clustering and Discussion</strong></p>
<p>After the brainstorming, gather and cluster the stickies on a wall, revealing duplicate concerns across the groups and thematic areas of concern.</p>
<p>As clusters become clear, ask if any events similar to this threat have already happened to the organization? What was the impact? Has it happened more than once? Regularly? Mark these threats.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Some of these threats may be traumatic experiences, consider skipping public discussion of historical occurrence if many of the threats from the brainstorm (or from one person/group in particular) are particularly intense.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Bow-tie</strong></p>
<p>Select one of the threats that emerged as a concern from the clustering to place at the center of a &quot;bow-tie&quot; like drawing on a whiteboard or flip-chart paper.</p>
<p>Begin asking what other threats identified could come as a result of this threat, supplanting the responses from the participants with additional threats. For example, a hacked website could lead to loss of trust by funders or partners. &quot;Chain reactions&quot; can be illustrated as lines of events (loss of trust by funders could lead to a loss of funding). Do the same for what threats could lead to the &quot;central&quot; threat - a confiscation of a device could lead to email hacking, for example. Some threats can be both potential causes and secondary effects.</p>
<p>Close out this with a discussion of how every threat is potentially connected to both digital and physical impacts.</p>

<p><!-- Debrief --></p>
<h2 id="debrief">Debrief</h2>
<h3 id="summary-56">Summary</h3>
<p>This component consists of an out-brief to key points of contact, providing basic pressure relief through group and individual interactions, and planning future follow-up with the host and key individuals.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-16">Purpose</h3>
<p>SAFETAG is an auditing framework designed to connect small civil society organizations and independent media outlets to the digital security services they need. But, more than that it is designed to provide audits that increase an organization's agency to seek out and address security challenges independently. This can be an auditor's last in-person chance to engage with the staff to shape their perspective of the audit.</p>
<p>The debrief allows the auditor to ensure that they leave the host and its staff ready to start addressing their digital security. By providing some immediate outcomes to the host and its staff, and in combination with training or security consultation in the Responsive Support section, the auditor can ensure that the host sees the audit as a guide instead of a condemnation.</p>

<p>This component allows an auditor to explain and get feedback on their report as well as evaluate the success of the process over time through a continued relationship with the host.</p>
<p>This component consists of the final meeting with the host and following up with them after a period of a few months to see if they need further assistance, are willing to share their experience working with any of the recommended resources, or as new resources are identified.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-17">Purpose</h3>
<p>Follow up can be a valuable tool for encouraging an organization to continue their digital security process. But, follow up needs to be desired by an organization and achievable for the auditor. As such, follow up must be minimally intrusive on both the auditor and the host's time.</p>

<h4>Follow-up Meeting</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Schedule and have a follow up call to discuss the audit report. This provides a valuable touch-point for the organization to read the report and ask any clarifying questions to the auditor, as well as for the auditor to underscore any important steps for the organization.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Walk through the report and discuss the priority findings</li>
<li>Schedule a long-term check-in call</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the report</li>
<li>A secure note-taking system.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>A secure, real-time VOIP system is recommended for this call, as many of the highly sensitive audit findings are likely to be discussed in detail. Skype may suffice in some regions, but also consider secure call options (https://ostel.co/).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>Each organization, and often even each key point of contact within the organization, will want to explore the report in different ways. Adapt to the needs of the organization, but make sure you cover the top-priority recommendations that the organization needs to consider in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Ask the organization to fill out Staff Feedback Surveys.</p>
<p>Ask if they need any specific resources or introductions not included in the report.</p>
<p>At the end of the call, schedule a second follow-up call to check in on their progress.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
</div>
<div class="boxtext">
<h4>Making Introductions</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Make introduction between host and known resources as needed.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Introduce relevant organizational representatives to resources</li>
<li>Follow up with both the organization and the resource later to check on progress</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Consider the implications of the meta-data (email addresses, subject lines, dates) involved in these introductions.</li>
<li>Provide PGP keys (signed if possible) for introductions where possible</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>Based on the specific recommendations in the audit report, as well as the auditor's understanding of the organization's capacity and barriers faced, introduce the relevant points of contact at the organization to resources such as digital security trainers, funding organizations which provide targeted support for digital security, technical experts to help on specific tasks (e.g. server hardening, website migration), as well as services that could help address their needs (e.g. secure hosting providers, rapid response support).</p>
<p>Follow up with both the organization and the resources introduced to check in on process and revise which introductions you make going forward.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
</div>
<div class="boxtext">
<h4>Long-Term Follow-up</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Follow up with host after a few months to check on progress, get long-term feedback and connect with any new resources.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the report</li>
<li>A secure note-taking system.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>A secure, real-time VOIP system is recommended for this call, as many of the highly sensitive audit findings are likely to be discussed in detail. Skype may suffice in some regions, but also consider secure call options (https://ostel.co/).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>This can be combined with the Staff Feedback Survey exercise, or to follow up on any concerns you have based on their responses to that survey. The main goal of the long-term follow-up is to ensure that the organization has ongoing connection points to any resources or connections they need to remove barriers to adoption.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
</div>
<div class="boxtext">
<h4>Staff Feedback Survey</h4>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>Providing a space for anonymous, guided feedback is valuable to gather information about how your audit work and the SAFETAG framework itself are supporting organizational understanding of risk and their ability to adapt. This long-term capacity building is critical to the SAFETAG framework, so finding ways to measure the impact of an audit towards these goals is important.</p>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>After providing a report to the organization, send them a survey (that they can complete anonymously) to gauge change in perceptions of risk, your efficacy as an auditor, and willingness to change/adapt</li>
<li>Compile results</li>
</ul>
<h5>Materials Needed</h5>
<ul>
<li>Survey questions</li>
<li>Platform or document for securely recording survey responses</li>
</ul>
<h5>Considerations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Provide this survey in a method that respects the client's need for privacy, security, and anonymity.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Walkthrough</h5>
<p>This exercise provides a simple survey you can implement in a variety of settings (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, via plain documents, etc.).</p>

<p><!-- Vulnerability Prioritization 

## Vulnerability Prioritization

"*Finding threats against arbitrary things is fun, but when you're building some-thing with many moving parts, you need to know where to start, and how to approach it.*" - _Threat Modeling: Designing for Security_ by Adam Shostack [^shostack_finding_threats]

### Summary

This component consists of the auditor organizing the vulnerabilities identified during the audit and prioritizing them within the risk matrix.

### Purpose


As part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing overwhelming. In addition, this component ranks the vulnerabilties identified using the risk-matrix developed with the host organization's staff. Using the host-created framework will allow for a deeper understanding of the impact of vulnerabilities and encourage greater investment in addressing them.

### Baseline Skills


### Preparation


### Materials Needed


### Approach


Vulnerability prioritization is a critical process. It is vital that the reasoning an auditor uses during this stage are documented and available within the report. If an auditor does not create accurate associations between the host identified impact or uses an inaccurate assessment of adversary capabilities it can lessen the credibility of the recommendations made.

  * Identify vulnerabilities environment and impact (per vulnerability)
    * Identify the possible impact of the vulnerability.
      * Identify any threats to critical process' the vulnerability makes possible.
      * Identify the process with the greatest impact if interrupted.
    * Identify the possibility of exploitation.
      * Identify the level of resources required to exploit the vulnerability.
      * Compare the resources required against the capabilities identified in the risk modeling activities and the contextual research you completed. 
    * Position the vulnerability on the risk matrix in relation to its likelihood and its impact.




### Outputs

  * A risk matrix with all vulnerabilities ranked on it.
  * An overview of the risks the organization is accepting until they address each vulnerability.
  * A short overview of the how the likelihood was determined for each vulnerability.
  * A listing of the process, impact, and likelihood for each vulnerability.


### Operational Security

  * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
  * Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization’s country, or is known to surveil.

<!-- Recommendation Development -->

<h2 id="recommendation-development-and-resource-identification">Recommendation Development and Resource Identification</h2>
<h3 id="summary-62">Summary</h3>
<p>In this component the auditor identifies the organization's strengths and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) to adopting new digital and physical security practices and documents the possible actions the organization could take on to address the vulnerabilities found during the audit, the difficulty of taking on those actions, and the resources that the host may be able to leverage to address them. Resources can include, but are not limited to, local technical support and incident response groups/trade organizations, places to obtain discount software, trainers, and guides/resrouces they can use to support their up-skilling.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-18">Purpose</h3>
<p>The host needs to be able to take action after an audit. The recommendations that an auditor provides to address vulnerabilities must cover a range that allows an organization to address them in both the short-term and more comprehensively in the long-term. Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses will allow the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve. In doing this the SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a trusted conduit between civil society organizations in need and organizations providing digital security training, technological support, legal assistance, and incident response.</p>
<h3 id="guiding-questions-17">Guiding Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the organizational areas of strength (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that the organization can leverage when engaging in technological adoption/change?</li>
<li>What are the organizational areas of weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that need to be taken into consideration when engaging in technological adoption/change?</li>
<li>What are the organizational barriers to adoption?</li>
<li>Are the recommendations you are providing directly related to the security audit? If not, do they support the organization in accomplishing their security tasks, or distract from them?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approaches-16">Approaches</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify and Explain Un-Addressed Concerns :</strong> Write explanations for why any adversaries or threats that the auditor identifies as &quot;un-addressable&quot; with the organizations current capacity.</li>

<h3 id="summary-66">Summary</h3>
<p>This component consists of an auditor sorting their recommendations in relation to the organizations threats and capacity.

<h3 id="purpose-19">Purpose</h3>
<p>As part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing overwhelming. An organization needs to be able to weigh their possible paths forward against the time lost from program activities, the cost to implement the threat, and the other threats that they are not addressing. Roadmapping is used to give the host the tools to make these decisions and provide them with a recommended path forward that will allow them to make immediate gains towards protecting themselves. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.</p>

<h3 id="purpose-20">Purpose</h3>
<p>Once an auditor has left, the report is the auditor's chance to continue a conversation (albeit a static one) -- even if the organization never talks to the auditor again.

For the auditor and the organization, it acts as documentation of what an auditor accomplished. For the organization, it will be guide for connecting vulnerabilities to actual risks, a rallying cry for change, and proof of need for funders. For those the organization brings in to support their digital security, it provides a roadmap towards that implementation and a task-list for future technologists and trainers paid to get the host there - as well as a checklist for validating that threats have been addressed.</p>

<h1>APPENDICES</h1>
<h2 id="appendix-draft-engagement-and-confidentiality-agreement">APPENDIX: Draft Engagement and Confidentiality Agreement</h2>
<p>In order to protect the privacy of SUBJECT, AUDITOR agrees to comply with the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>AUDITOR commits to prioritizing the stability and integrity of SUBJECT’s digital infrastructure over any additional testing could be carried through more aggressive methods. AUDITOR will make every effort to avoid disrupting SUBJECT's work environment, even temporarily. No tests will be performed that would stress the network, or any individual workstation, beyond what could be expected from normal use. If he has any doubt, AUDITOR will consult with SUBJECT before carrying out the test.</li>
<li>AUDITOR will not share the assessment report—or any notes created, data gathered or knowledge obtained about SUBJECT during the evaluation—with anyone other than a single point of contact, designated by SUBJECT. AUDITOR may need to share some general information with SUBJECT staff, as part of requesting information necessary to carry out the audit itself. If AUDITOR has any concern that this could be sensitive, he will first clear it with that point of contact. This commitment to protecting SUBJECT's private information extends to AUDITOR’s colleagues, supervisor and funder, all of whom have demonstrated their own respect for this policy in three previous audits. The only details about the assessment that will be shared, confidentially, with these three groups (and only these three groups) will include: a) the name and location of the organization audited; b) basic time line information; and, with SUBJECT's approval, anonymized “lessons learned,” which will be aggregated with those from at least one other assessment. During and after the audit itself, all data will be stored securely in an encrypted volume on AUDITOR’s computer.</li>
<li>AUDITOR himself will securely delete all data from the audit one week after submitting the final assessment report to SUBJECT or, any time, should SUBJECT's request it.</li>
<li>If, at any time, AUDITOR feels that he might be called upon to give advice that could be out of line with SUBJECT's own IT policies, he will first clear it with SUBJECT.</li>
<li>AUDITOR will work with whatever level of access SUBJECT is comfortable providing. This includes access to staff members for brief &quot;interviews,&quot; as well as more technical access, such as passwords, local connectivity, privileged or unprivileged accounts on local or remote services, etc.. That said, some level of access typically allows an auditor to produce a report that is significantly more useful than the output a pure &quot;black box&quot; audit. (And this is doubly true when the auditor wishes to tread lightly in order to avoid impacting the stability of the subject’s network infrastructure and the productivity of its staff.)</li>

<h2 id="appendix-password-dictionaries">APPENDIX: Password Dictionaries</h2>
<h3 id="password-dictionary-creation-2">Password Dictionary Creation</h3>
<h4 id="summary-68">Summary</h4>
<p>This component provides resources and recommendations on cracking passwords - both the creation of dictionaries and rules to modify those dictionaries, as well as some basic implementation as well. This is a dangerous (and in many cases, illegal) skill to use, and should be more of a guide to auditors on what password security myths do not work against modern password cracking software, and to use only with permission and only in very specific situations as a demonstration of the power of even a common laptop against weak passwords.</p>
<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Weak passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of well-publicized global password breaches, &quot;password&quot; and &quot;12345&quot; remain the most popular passwords. This exercise supports the auditor in building an effective dictionary and using it to attack non-personal and non-disruptive parts of an organization's infrastructure. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.</p>
<p>This skillset, plus demonstration against non-invasive accounts, provides an opening for a discussion with staff on password security. See <a href="https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/secure-passwords">Level Up</a> for further activities and exercises around passwords.</p>
<h4 id="approach-3">Approach</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download basic word lists</li>
<li>Research dictionary needs</li>
<li>Create custom word list</li>
<li>Build core list(s)</li>
<li>Attack a password hash using increasingly more time-consuming methods</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="instructions-2">Instructions</h4>
<p>Primarily for use in the Network Access component, building a password dictionary, understanding the ways to automatically mutate it, and running it against passwords is a useful skill to have, and to use to explain why simple passwords are insecure. This <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/">Ars Technica article</a> provides a good insight into the path to tackle iterative password cracking using a variety of tools to meet different goals.</p>
<p>These instructions use a small set of password cracking tools, but many are possible. If there are tools you are more familiar or comfortable with using, these by no means are required. The only constraints are to be respectful and responsible, as well as keeping focused on the overall goals and not getting bogged down.</p>
<p>A good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break most passwords. Using a collection of all English words, all words from the language of the organization being audited, plus a combination of all these words, plus relevant keywords, addresses, and years tends to crack most wifi passwords in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>An approach which begins with quick, but often fruitful, attacks to more and more complex (and time consuming) attacks is the most rewarding. However, after an hour or two of password hacking, the in-office time on other activities is more valuable, so admit defeat and move on. See the Recommendations section for talking points around the levels of password cracking that exist in the world. You can work on passwords offline/overnight/post-audit for report completeness.</p>
<p>Here is a suggested path to take with suggested tools to help. You might try the first few steps in both the targeted keyword approach and the dictionary approach before moving on to the more complex mutations towards the end of each path.</p>
<ul>
<li>Targeted Keywords</li>
<li>Begin with a simple combination of organizationally relevant keywords (using hashcat's combinator attack, combining your org keyword list with itself)</li>
<li>Add in numbers/years (simple scripting, hashcat, JtR)</li>
<li>Add in other mutators like 1337 replacements, capitalization tricks (John)</li>
<li>Language dictionary attack (simple scripting, hashcat)</li>
<li>Run a series of dictionary word attacks:
<ul>
<li>A simple language dictionary attack</li>
<li>Add in numbers/years (simple scripting, hashcat, JtR)</li>
<li>Add in the org keywords (a full combination creates a massive list, recommend starting with 1:1)</li>
<li>Try other combinations of the dictionary, keywords, years</li>
<li>Add in other mutators like 1337 replacements, capitalization tricks (John)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brute forcing (do not bother with this on-site)</li>
<li>John's incremental modes, limited by types</li>
<li>Crunch's raw brute-force attack (very, very time intensive - a complete waste of time without GPUs)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dictionary-research-and-creation-1">Dictionary Research and Creation</h4>
<p><strong>Before you arrive on-site</strong> it is important to have your password cracking tools downloaded and relevant dictionaries ready to go, as your main demonstration and use of these tools is to gain access to the organization's network. The effectiveness of this demonstration is drastically reduced if you already have had to ask for the password to connect to the Internet and update your dictionaries, tools, or so on. Some of these files (especially larger password dictionaries) can be quite large, so downloading them in-country is not recommended.</p>
<p>Many password dictionary sites, such as <a href="https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords">SkullSecurity</a> , maintain core dictionaries in multiple languages. If your target language is not available, some quick regular expression work can turn spell-check dictionaries (such as those used by <a href="http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center?getCategories=Dictionary">LibreOffice</a> into useful word lists. It is generally useful to always test with English in addition to the target language.</p>
<p>[CloudCracker(]https://www.cloudcracker.com/dictionaries.html) and <a href="http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/">OpenWall</a> have, for a fee, well-tested password dictionaries.</p>
<h3 id="keyword-generation-1">Keyword generation</h3>
<p>In addition, create a customized dictionary with words related to the subject as revealed in the Remote Assessment research -- including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organization name (complete and broken down into syllables)</li>
<li>Organizational acronyms</li>
<li>Organizational registration numbers (business/tax ID)</li>
<li>street address / city / state / country</li>
<li>phone number</li>
<li>email/web domain</li>
<li>wireless network name or BSSID</li>
<li>Founders</li>
<li>Keywords from program themes, mission, vision</li>
<li>Founding date of the organization (note the local date system)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the organization &quot;ExampleOrg , which has its offices at 123 Central St., Federal District, Countryzstan , which does human rights and journalism work and was founded in 1992, some context-based dictionary additions would be:</p>
<pre><code>exampleorg
example
org
EO
123
central
federal
district
countryzstan
human
rights
journo
journalism
1992
92</code></pre>
<p>Also add common password fragments: qwerty, 1234/5/6/7/8, and, based on field experience, four-digit dates back for ~20 years in both the Gregorian (Western) and (if relevant) local calendar, plus the founding year of the organization). It's quite amazing how often a recent year will be part of a wifi password -- this presentation discusses many common patterns in passwords: https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf</p>
<h5 id="optional-further-steps-1">Optional Further steps</h5>
<p>Use <a href="http://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php">CeWL</a>, to spider the organization's web properties to generate additional phrases. This list will need review, as some of the generated content is not very useful, but may be useful if the site is not in a language the auditor reads fluently.</p>
<p>For passwords other than WPA, specific policies or patterns may help to focus your password dictionary further. <a href="https://github.com/iphelix/PACK">PACK, or Password Analysis and Cracking Toolkit</a> is a collection of utilities developed to aid in analysis of password lists in order to enhance password cracking through pattern detection of masks, rules, character-sets and other password characteristics. The toolkit generates valid input files for Hashcat family of password crackers.&quot; PACK is most useful for large sets of passwords, where it can detect patterns in already-broken passwords to help build new rules. Both password cracking tools listed here are powerful, and have slightly different abilities. The auditor should choose the one they prefer and/or the one which has the features they desire for this job.</p>
<h4 id="combinator-attack-with-scripting-and-hashcat-1">Combinator Attack with scripting and Hashcat</h4>
<p>One quick way to build a more complex password list is to simply double the list up (a &quot;combinator&quot; attack), so that it includes an entry for each pair of these strings:</p>
<p>You can do a 1-way version of this list simply, such as:</p>
<pre><code> $ for foo in `cat pwdlist.txt`; do for bar in `cat pwdlist.txt`; do printf $foo$bar&#39;\n&#39;; done; done &gt; pwdpairs.txt
 $ cat pwdlist.txt &gt;&gt; pwdpairs.txt</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/">Hashcat</a> can do this in a live attack under its &quot;combinator&quot; mode, and hashcat-utils (hiding in /usr/share/hashcat-utils/combinator.bin) provides this as a standalone tool. This provides a true combination of the list, so it exponentially increases the list size - use with caution, or use with one larger dictionary and one smaller dictionary.</p>
<p>For example, use these combination approach on your custom dictionary (combining it with itself, creating combinations from the above list such as example92, journorights, exampleorgrights).</p>
<pre><code>$  /usr/share/hashcat-utils/combinator.bin dict.txt dict.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Hashcat is extremely powerful when you have desktop computer systems to use, but has a few wordlist manipulation tools that are useful regardless.</p>

<h4 id="word-mutation-with-john-the-ripper-jtr-1">Word mutation with John the Ripper (JtR)</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/commits/bleeding-jumbo">JtR</a> is a powerful tool you can use in combination of existing wordlists, but it also can add in common substitutions (people using zero for the letter &quot;o&quot;). JtR can be used to generate a static list of passwords for other programs, or it can be used directly against a password database. JtR is a bit weak combining words within a wordlist, so you should apply your customizations and any folding before moving on to JtR.</p>
<p>You can add custom &quot;rules&quot; to aid in these substitutions - a base set is included with JtR, but a much more powerful set is added by [KoreLogic] (http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html). KoreLogic also provides a custom character set &quot;chr file&quot; that takes password frequency data from large collections of <a href="http://www.korelogic.com/tools.html">real-world passwords to speed up JtR's brute force mode</a> . This PDF presentation has a good <a href="https://www.owasp.org/images/a/af/2011-Supercharged-Slides-Redman-OWASP-Feb.pdf">walkthrough of how John and Kore's rules work</a></p>
<p>Additional guides: * (http://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux)</p>
<p>The bleeding-edge jumbo version combines both the built-in rules and an optimized version of the <a href="https://github.com/kost/jtr-stuff/tree/master/rules,%20and%20http://openwall.info/wiki/john/rules%20for%20a%20description%20of%20the%20optimizations">KoreLogic rules</a>. <a href="http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html">This list of KoreLogic Rules</a> provides nice descriptions of what the KoreLogic rules do. In bleeding-jumbo, you can remove &quot;KoreLogicRules&quot;. <a href="http://backreference.org/2009/10/26/password-recovery-with-john-the-ripper/">BackReference</a> provides a great example of rules usage.</p>
<p>Some particularly useful ones individual rulesets are: * AppendYears (appends years, from 1900 to 2019) and AppendCurrentYearSpecial (appends 2000-2019 with punctuation) * AddJustNumbers (adds 1-4 digits to the end of everything) * l33t (leet-speek combinations)</p>
<p>There are some build-in combinations of rulesets - for example, just --rules runs john's internal collection of default rules, and --rules:KoreLogic runs a collection of the KoreLogic rules in a thoughtful order, and --rules:all is useful if you hate life.</p>
<p>e.g. :</p>
<pre><code>  $ john -w:dictionary.txt --rules:AppendYears --stdout</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/RULES.shtml">Building custom rules</a></p>
<p><strong>PROTIP</strong> Create a dictionary with just &quot;blah&quot; and run various rules against it to understand how each ruleset or combination works. Note specifically that each rule multiplies the size of the dictionary by the number of permutations it introduces. Running the KoreLogic ruleset combination against a <strong>one word</strong> dictionary creates a list of 6,327,540 permutations on just that word.</p>
<h4 id="brute-force-using-john-and-crunch-1">Brute force, using John and crunch</h4>
<p>JtR's &quot;incremental&quot; mode is essentially an optimized brute force attack, so will take a very long time for anything but the shortest passwords, or passwords where you can limit the search space to a character set: &quot;As of version 1.8.0, pre-defined incremental modes are &quot;ASCII&quot; (all 95 printable ASCII characters), &quot;LM_ASCII&quot; (for use on LM hashes), &quot;Alnum&quot; (all 62 alphanumeric characters), &quot;Alpha&quot; (all 52 letters), &quot;LowerNum&quot; (lowercase letters plus digits, for 36 total), &quot;UpperNum&quot; (uppercase letters plus digits, for 36 total), &quot;LowerSpace&quot; (lowercase letters plus space, for 27 total), &quot;Lower&quot; (lowercase letters), &quot;Upper&quot; (uppercase letters), and &quot;Digits&quot; (digits only). The supplied .chr files include data for lengths up to 13 for all of these modes except for &quot;LM_ASCII&quot; (where password portions input to the LM hash halves are assumed to be truncated at length 7) and &quot;Digits&quot; (where the supplied .chr file and pre-defined incremental mode work for lengths up to 20). Some of the many .chr files needed by these pre-defined incremental modes might not be bundled with every version of John the Ripper, being available as a separate download.&quot; (http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/MODES.shtml)</p>
<p>As a last resort, you can try a direct brute force attack overnight or post-audit to fill in details on key strength. Crunch is a very simple but thorough approach. Given enough time it will break a password, but it's not particularly fast, even at simple passwords. You can reduce the scope of this attack (and speed it up) if you have a reason to believe the password is all lower-case, all-numeric, or so on. WPA passwords are a minimum of 8 characters, a maximum of 16, and some wifi routers will accept punctuation, but in practice these are usually just !@#$. — so:</p>
<pre><code>$ /path/to/crunch 8 16 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890$!@#$. | aircrack-ng -a 2 path/to/capture.pcap -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w -</code></pre>
<p>This says to try every possible alpha-numeric combination from 8 to 16 characters. This will take a very, very, very long time.</p>
<h4 id="recommendations-1">Recommendations</h4>
<p>Any important password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent both standard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters of powerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character combination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a passphrase that contains five or more relatively uncommon words.) The key should not contain common “phrases,” expecially from well known literature like Shakespeare or religious texts, but also should not include number sequences or phrases, especially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work.</p>
<p>Specifically for wireless passwords, choosing a strong WPA key is one of the most ild not mportant steps toward defending an organization’s network perimeter from an adversary with the ability to spend some time in the vicinity of the offices. By extension, mitigating this vulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and confidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings down even the most well-secured information systems.</p>
<p>Because shared keys inevitably end up being written on whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the WPA key should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen frequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.</p>
<h4 id="sample-practice">Sample Practice</h4>
<p>For practice on any of these methods, you can use the wpa-Induction.pcap file from <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures">Wireshark</a>.</p>

<p>Note that password cracking systems are rated on the number of password guesses they make per second. Stock laptop computers without high-end graphics cards or any other optimizations can guess 2500 passwords/second. More powerful desktop computers can test over a hundred million each second, and with graphics cards (GPUs) that rises to billions of passwords per second. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking).</p>
<p>This website has a good explanation about how improving the complexity of a password affects how easy it is to break: http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi , but is using very out of date numbers - consider a basic laptop able to produce &quot;Class E&quot; attacks, and a desktop, &quot;Class F&quot;</p>

<li>cd recon-ng</li>
<li>Install pip (sudo apt-get install python-pip) and dependencies: pip install -r REQUIREMENTS</li>
<li>Launch Recon-ng: ./recon-ng</li>

<p>For full instructions, see the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/wiki/Usage%20Guide#!getting-started">Recon-ng Getting Started Instructions</a></p>
<h3 id="using-recon-ng">Using Recon-ng</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the short <a href="https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/wiki/Usage%20Guide">Recon-ng Usage Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: This guide is based upon the data flow documentation from the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/overview">Recon-ng website</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Interface Basics</li>
</ul>
<p>By pressing tab twice you can use auto-completion.</p>
<pre><code>[recon-ng][default] &gt; 
add         exit        load        record      search      show        use         
back        help        pdb         reload      set         spool       workspaces  
del         keys        query       resource    shell       unset </code></pre>
<p>This works even in commands.</p>
<pre><code>[recon-ng][default] &gt; show 
banner           credentials      hosts            locations        options          schema
companies        dashboard        keys             modules          ports            vulnerabilities
contacts         domains          leaks            netblocks        pushpins         workspaces</code></pre>
<p>Using recon modules</p>
<p>The recon modules are named in a very specific fashion to help the user understand the flow of data inside the tool. Modules use the syntax <code>&lt;methodology step&gt;/&lt;input table&gt;-&lt;output table&gt;/&lt;module&gt;</code>. The inputs are the first part of each module, and the outputs are the second part. The module name itself is the tool used to process the data. So, recon/domains-hosts/brute-hosts takes domain names (websitename.org) as an input, and outputs hostnames (extranet.websitename.org, etc.). If you provide the name of the specific module, recon-ng can figure it out (though tab completion doesn't help) -- for example, <code>use  breachalarm</code> works just as well as <code>use recon/contacts-creds/breachalarm</code></p>
<p>You can also search modules by their inputs or outputs. <code>search domains-</code> displays all modules that take domain names as their input, and <code>search -contacts</code> displays all modules that outputs contact information.</p>
<h4 id="preparing">Preparing</h4>
<p>Set verboseness on during the guide so that you can see everything that happens. (recommended to begin with)</p>
<pre><code>[recon-ng][default] &gt; set VERBOSE True</code></pre>

<p>It seems the website leillc.net is obviously not associated with the company I am doing recon on. Since this module has finished, we will leave it using the <code>back</code> command.</p>

The same is true of you and your pen test reports, just because its finished doesn't mean you can switch off entirely. You still have to get the report out to the client, and you have to do so securely. Electronic distribution using public key cryptography is probably the best option, but not always possible. If symmetric encryption is to be used, a strong key should be used and must be transmitted out of band. Under no circumstances should a report be transmitted unencrypted.
