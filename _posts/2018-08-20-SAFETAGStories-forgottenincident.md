*This is the second in a series of blog posts sharing some stories gleaned from audits over the years (often combined from multiple experiences and with all identifying information removed).  The goal is to share experiences and approaches to help new auditors get into the mindset of SAFETAG*

In the [previous SAFETAG Story](/2018/08/16/SAFETAGStories-dropbox.html), we explained the “TRI” approach in choosing activities which take different approaches (**Technical**, **Research**, **Interpersonal**) in order to TRI-angulate (!!!) the reality of what is going on at an organization. That variety is critical, but sometimes not enough.

Even within one category, sometimes one approach just doesn’t work with the organization. The activity may be geared towards a small group, but the organization is large. It may expect people to be in one room, but the organization is distributed across locations and even time zones. Sometimes, it may just not work for reasons that are not clear.

**Process Mapping** is an example of an activity that is both absolutely central to an assessment, but also incredibly complex, occasionally political, and (at least in my experience) the activity most likely to fail or be met with confusion or resistance.

### The Forgotten incident

At one audit, the audit team had gone through the normal motions of process mapping, talking about potential adversaries, ranking what risks and their impacts were not acceptable, as well as research around digital challenges faced in their country and around their issue area. After almost a week, we had simply not found any specific concerns beyond the normal outdated computers and network glitches, and were looking forward to a simple and straightforward audit findings and recommendations reporting process.  SAFETAG recommends having some form of “debrief” at the end of every audit, to respect concerns and provide one last point of contact and reassurance to staff. During this, someone casually mentioned a theft from a few years back, where only the hard drives of the computers were stolen.

That… is an odd and very specific thing to steal. We had to have additional conversations to re-scope and re-prioritize some of the recommendations we had planned on providing, as well as re-think what threats this organization was actually facing.  

### The Misunderstanding

Another time, the organization was pushing back against the process mapping activity as being irrelevant to risk assessment -- after all, the organization already knew how they did their work, and wanted to focus on the threat actors they faced and their abilities. I was caught a bit off guard by this, as we had discussed it ahead of time with the management team in terms of scoping and preparing staff for the audit. I was mentally gearing up to drop it and move to the sensitive data mapping activity, as it can be leveraged to pull out the same process disconnects and vulnerabilities with a bit of extra work. I asked for 15 more minutes to explore the process mapping approach, and if the staff still felt it was a waste of time, we'd change course.
