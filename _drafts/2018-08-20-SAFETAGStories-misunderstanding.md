*This is the second in a series of blog posts sharing some stories gleaned from audits over the years (often combined from multiple experiences and with all identifying information removed).  The goal is to share experiences and approaches to help new auditors get into the mindset of SAFETAG*

In the [first SAFETAG Story](/2018/08/16/SAFETAGStories-dropbox.html), we explained the “TRI” approach in choosing activities which take different approaches (**Technical**, **Research**, **Interpersonal**) in order to TRI-angulate (!!!) the reality of what is going on at an organization. That variety is critical, but sometimes not enough.

**Process Mapping** is an example of an activity that is both absolutely central to an assessment, but also incredibly complex, occasionally political, and (at least in my experience) the activity most likely to fail or be met with confusion or resistance.
In the Process Mapping activity,  the assessor works with the organization, or select parts of it (for larger organizations) to dive into the details of how the organization works. It is often the most challenging, and most information-rich activities of the SAFETAG framework.

### The Misunderstanding

Another time, the organization was pushing back against the process mapping activity as being irrelevant to risk assessment -- after all, the organization already knew how they did their work, and wanted to focus on the threat actors they faced and their abilities. I was caught a bit off guard by this, as we had discussed it ahead of time with the management team in terms of scoping and preparing staff for the audit. I was mentally gearing up to drop it and move to the sensitive data mapping activity, as it can be leveraged to pull out the same process disconnects and vulnerabilities with a bit of extra work. I asked for 15 more minutes to explore the process mapping approach, and if the staff still felt it was a waste of time, we'd change course.
